            <p class="card-text">A graph is an abstract data type that is meant 
                to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts 
                from mathematics, specifically the field of graph theory.                
                A graph is a pictorial representation of a set 
                of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. 
                The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as 
                vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called 
                edges.</p>
            
            <p>Formally, a graph is a pair of sets (V, E), where V is the set of
               vertices and E is the set of edges, connecting the pairs of 
               vertices.</p>

<pre>
<code>            
V = {a, b, c, d, e}

            <h3>Graph Data Structure</h3>            
            <p>A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly 
               mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set 
               of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or 
               a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are 
               known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as 
               arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a 
               directed graph. The vertices may be part of the graph structure, 
               or may be external entities represented by integer indices or 
               references.</p>

            <p>A graph data structure may also associate to each edge some edge 
               value, such as a symbolic label or a numeric attribute 
               (cost, capacity, length, etc.).</p>

        <p><sup>see <a href="../../data-structures/index.html#graph">Data Structures</a> 
         to learn more...</sup></p>
            
            <p>Mathematical graphs can be represented in data structure. We can 
               represent a graph using an array of vertices and a 
               two-dimensional array of edges. Before we proceed further, let's 
               familiarize ourselves with some important terms:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Vertex − Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex. 
                           In the following example, the labeled circle 
                           represents vertices. Thus, A to G are vertices. We 
                           can represent them using an array as shown in the 
                           following image. Here A can be identified by index 0.
                           B can be identified using index 1 and so on.</li>
              <li>Edge − Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line 
                         between two vertices. In the following example, the 
                         lines from A to B, B to C, and so on represents edges. 
                         We can use a two-dimensional array to represent an 
                         array as shown in the following image. Here AB can be 
                         represented as 1 at row 0, column 1, BC as 1 at row 1, 
                         column 2 and so on, keeping other combinations as 
                         0.</li>
              <li>Adjacency − Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are 
                              connected to each other through an edge. In the 
                              following example, B is adjacent to A, C is 
                              adjacent to B, and so on.</li>
              <li>Path − Path represents a sequence of edges between the two 
                         vertices. In the following example, ABCD represents a 
                         path from A to D.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Basic Operations</h4>
            <p>Following are basic primary operations of a Graph provided by a 
                graph data structure G usually include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>display_vertex: displays vertex of the graph;</li>
              <li>adjacent(G, x, y): tests whether there is an edge from the 
                  vertex x to the vertex y;</li>
              <li>neighbors(G, x): lists all vertices y such that there is an 
                  edge from the vertex x to the vertex y;</li>
              <li>add_vertex(G, x): adds the vertex x, if it is not there;</li>
              <li>remove_vertex(G, x): removes the vertex x, if it is 
                  there;</li>
              <li>add_edge(G, x, y): adds the edge from the vertex x to the 
                  vertex y, if it is not there;</li>
              <li>remove_edge(G, x, y): removes the edge from the vertex x to 
                  the vertex y, if it is there;</li>
              <li>get_vertex_value(G, x): returns the value associated with the 
                  vertex x;</li>
              <li>set_vertex_value(G, x, v): sets the value associated with the 
                  vertex x to v.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Structures that associate values to the edges usually also 
                provide:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>get_edge_value(G, x, y): returns the value associated with the
                  edge (x, y);</li>
              <li>set_edge_value(G, x, y, v): sets the value associated with the
                  edge (x, y) to v.</li>
            </ul>

            <a name="traversal" id="traversal"></a>                              
            <h4>Graph Traversal</h4>
            <p>Graph traversal (also known as graph search) refers to the 
               process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a 
               graph. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the 
               vertices are visited. Tree traversal is a special case of graph 
               traversal.</p>
          
            <h4>Redundancy</h4>
            <p>Unlike tree traversal, graph traversal may require that some 
               vertices be visited more than once, since it is not necessarily 
               known before transitioning to a vertex that it has already been 
               explored. As graphs become more dense, this redundancy becomes 
               more prevalent, causing computation time to increase; as graphs 
               become more sparse, the opposite holds true.</p>

            <p>Thus, it is usually necessary to remember which vertices have 
               already been explored by the algorithm, so that vertices are 
               revisited as infrequently as possible (or in the worst case, to 
               prevent the traversal from continuing indefinitely). This may be
               accomplished by associating each vertex of the graph with a 
               "color" or "visitation" state during the traversal, which is 
               then checked and updated as the algorithm visits each vertex. 
               If the vertex has already been visited, it is ignored and the 
               path is pursued no further; otherwise, the algorithm 
               checks/updates the vertex and continues down its current 
               path.</p>

            <p>Several special cases of graphs imply the visitation of other 
               vertices in their structure, and thus do not require that 
               visitation be explicitly recorded during the traversal. An 
               important example of this is a tree: during a traversal it may 
               be assumed that all "ancestor" vertices of the current vertex 
               (and others depending on the algorithm) have already been 
               visited. Both the depth-first and breadth-first graph searches 
               are adaptations of tree-based algorithms, distinguished primarily
               by the lack of a structurally determined "root" vertex and the 
               addition of a data structure to record the traversal's 
               visitation state.</p>
                        
            <a name="depth" id="depth"></a>                                        
            <h4>Depth First Traversal</h4>
            <p>Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm traverses a graph in a 
               depthward motion and uses a stack to remember to get the next 
               vertex to start a search, when a dead end occurs in any 
               iteration.</p>

            <p>As in the example given above, DFS algorithm traverses from S to 
                A to D to G to E to B first, then to F and lastly to C. It
                employs the following rules.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Rule 1 − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as 
                           visited. Display it. Push it in a stack.</li>
              <li>Rule 2 − If no adjacent vertex is found, pop up a vertex from 
                           the stack. (It will pop up all the vertices from the 
                           stack, which do not have adjacent vertices.)</li>
              <li>Rule 3 − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the stack is 
                           empty.</li>
            </ul>

            
            <strong>Steps</strong>
            <ol>    
              <li>Initialize the stack.</li>
              <li>Mark S as visited and put it onto the stack. Explore any unvisited 
                    adjacent node from S. We have three nodes and we can pick any of them. 
                    For this example, we shall take the node in an alphabetical order.</li>
              <li>Mark A as visited and put it onto the stack. Explore any unvisited 
                    adjacent node from A. Both S and D are adjacent to A but we are 
                    concerned for unvisited nodes only.</li>
              <li>Visit D and mark it as visited and put onto the stack. Here, we have B 
                    and C nodes, which are adjacent to D and both are unvisited. However, 
                    we shall again choose in an alphabetical order.</li>
              <li>We choose B, mark it as visited and put onto the stack. Here B does not 
                    have any unvisited adjacent node. So, we pop B from the stack.</li>
              <li>We check the stack top for return to the previous node and check if it 
                    has any unvisited nodes. Here, we find D to be on the top of the 
                    stack.</li>
              <li>Only unvisited adjacent node is from D is C now. So we visit C, mark it 
                    as visited and put it onto the stack.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>As C does not have any unvisited adjacent node so we keep popping
               the stack until we find a node that has an unvisited adjacent 
               node. In this case, there's none and we keep popping until the 
               stack is empty.</p>
            
            <a name="breadth" id="breadth"></a>                                          
            <h4>Breadth First Traversal</h4>          
            <p>Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm traverses a graph in a 
               breadthward motion and uses a queue to remember to get the next 
               vertex to start a search, when a dead end occurs in any 
               iteration.</p>

            <p>As in the example given above, BFS algorithm traverses from A to 
                B to E to F first then to C and G lastly to D. It employs the 
                following rules.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Rule 1 − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as 
                           visited. Display it. Insert it in a queue.</li>
              <li>Rule 2 − If no adjacent vertex is found, remove the first 
                           vertex from the queue.</li>
              <li>Rule 3 − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the queue is 
                           empty.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Steps</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Initialize the queue.</li>
              <li>We start from visiting S (starting node), and mark it as visited.</li>
              <li>We then see an unvisited adjacent node from S. In this example, we have 
                    three nodes but alphabetically we choose A, mark it as visited and 
                    enqueue it.</li>
              <li>Next, the unvisited adjacent node from S is B. We mark it as visited and
                    enqueue it.</li>
              <li>Next, the unvisited adjacent node from S is C. We mark it as visited and
                    enqueue it.</li>
              <li>Now, S is left with no unvisited adjacent nodes. So, we dequeue and 
                    find A.</li>
              <li>From A we have D as unvisited adjacent node. We mark it as visited and 
                    enqueue it.</li>
            </ol>        

            <p>At this stage, we are left with no unmarked (unvisited) nodes. 
               But as per the algorithm we keep on dequeuing in order to get all
               unvisited nodes. When the queue gets emptied, the program is 
               over.</p>

        <p>Alright, let's recap what I've just learned:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>A graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the 
                undirected graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics, 
                specifically the field of graph theory. A graph is a pictorial 
                representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects 
                are connected by links. The interconnected objects are 
                represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that 
                connect the vertices are called edges.</li>          
        </ul>
