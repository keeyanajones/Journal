        <p>This section includes information about Esports.</p>
    
        <p>Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a 
          form of competition using video games. Esports often takes the form 
          of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between 
          professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized online 
          and offline competitions have long been a part of video game culture, 
          these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when 
          participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events 
          through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity. By the 2010s, 
          esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many 
          game developers actively designing toward a professional esports 
          subculture.</p>

        <p>The most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer 
          online battle arena (MOBA), first-person shooter (FPS), fighting, digital 
          collectible card games, battle royale games, and real-time strategy (RTS). 
          Popular esports games include League of Legends, Dota 2, Counter-Strike, 
          Call of Duty, Rainbow Six Siege, Overwatch, Street Fighter, 
          Super Smash Bros., Hearthstone, Fortnite Battle Royale, and StarCraft, 
          among many others. Tournaments such as the League of Legends World 
          Championship, Dota 2's The International, the fighting games-specific 
          Evolution Championship Series (EVO), and the Intel Extreme Masters provide 
          live broadcasts of the competition and prize money to competitors. Many 
          competitions use a series of promotion and relegation play with sponsored 
          teams, such as the League of Legends World Championship, but more recently, 
          competitions structured similar to American professional sports, with 
          salaried players and regular season and play-off series, have emerged, 
          such as the Overwatch League. The legitimacy of esports as a sports 
          competition remains in question; however, esports has been featured 
          alongside traditional sports in multinational events, and the International 
          Olympic Committee has explored incorporating them into future Olympic events.</p>
        
        <p>In 2019, it was estimated that the total audience of esports would grow 
          to 454 million viewers and that revenues would increase to over US$1 
          billion. The increasing availability of online streaming media 
          platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch have become central to the 
          growth and promotion of esports competitions. Demographically, Major 
          League Gaming has reported viewership that is approximately 85% male and 
          15% female, with a majority of viewers between the ages of 18 and 34.
          Despite this, several female personalities within esports are hopeful about 
          the increasing presence of female gamers. South Korea has several 
          established esports organizations, which have licensed pro gamers since the 
          year 2000. Recognition of esports competitions outside of South Korea has 
          come somewhat slower, with other events taking place in Europe, North America 
          and China. Despite its large video game market, esports in Japan is relatively 
          underdeveloped, and this has been attributed largely to its broad 
          anti-gambling laws which prohibit paid professional gaming tournaments.</p>
