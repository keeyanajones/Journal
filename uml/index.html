              Unified Modeling Language (UML)</a></li>
        </ol>
                                    
        <p>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, 
           developmental, modeling language in the field of software 
           engineering, that is intended to provide a standard way to 
           visualize the design of a system.</p>

        <p>The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to 
           standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to 
           software design. In 1997 UML was adopted as a standard by the Object 
           Management Group (OMG), and has been managed by this organization 
           ever since. In 2005 UML was also published by the International 
           Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard.
           Since then the standard has been periodically revised to cover the 
           latest revision of UML.</p>

        <a name="overview" id="overview"></a>                               
        <h5>Overview </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>UML is different from the other common programming languages 
                such as C++, Java, COBOL, etc.</li>
            <li>UML is a pictorial language used to make software 
                blueprints.</li>
            <li>UML can be described as a general purpose visual modeling 
                language to visualize, specify, construct, and document software
                system.</li>
            <li>Although UML is generally used to model software systems, it is 
                not limited within this boundary. It is also used to model 
                non-software systems as well. For example, the process flow in 
                a manufacturing unit, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>UML is not a programming language but tools can be used to generate 
           code in various languages using UML diagrams. UML has a direct 
           relation with object oriented analysis and design. After some 
           standardization, UML has become an OMG standard.</p>
        
        <a name="goals" id="goals"></a>                               
        <h5>Goals of UML</h5>
        <p>A picture is worth a thousand words, this idiom absolutely fits 
           describing UML. Object-oriented concepts were introduced much earlier
           than UML. At that point of time, there were no standard methodologies
           to organize and consolidate the object-oriented development. It was 
           then that UML came into picture.</p>

        <p>There are a number of goals for developing UML but the most important
           is to define some general purpose modeling language, which all 
           modelers can use and it also needs to be made simple to understand 
           and use.</p>

        <p>UML diagrams are not only made for developers but also for business 
           users, common people, and anybody interested to understand the 
           system. The system can be a software or non-software system. Thus it 
           must be clear that UML is not a development method rather it 
           accompanies with processes to make it a successful system.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, the goal of UML can be defined as a simple modeling 
           mechanism to model all possible practical systems in today’s complex 
           environment.</p>

        <a name="conceptual" id="conceptual"></a>                               
        <h5>A Conceptual Model of UML</h5>
        <p>To understand the conceptual model of UML, first we need to clarify 
           what is a conceptual model? and why a conceptual model is 
           required?</p>

        <p>A conceptual model can be defined as a model which is made of 
           concepts and their relationships.</p>

        <p>A conceptual model is the first step before drawing a UML diagram. It
           helps to understand the entities in the real world and how they 
           interact with each other.</p>

        <p>As UML describes the real-time systems, it is very important to make 
           a conceptual model and then proceed gradually. The conceptual model 
           of UML can be mastered by learning the following three major 
           elements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>UML building blocks</li>
          <li>Rules to connect the building blocks</li>
          <li>Common mechanisms of UML</li>
        </ul>
        
        <a name="ooconcepts" id="ooconcepts"></a>                               
        <h5>Object-Oriented Concepts</h5>
        <p>UML can be described as the successor of object-oriented (OO) 
           analysis and design.</p>

        <p>An object contains both data and methods that control the data. The 
           data represents the state of the object. A class describes an object 
           and they also form a hierarchy to model the real-world system. The 
           hierarchy is represented as inheritance and the classes can also be 
           associated in different ways as per the requirement.</p>

        <p>Objects are the real-world entities that exist around us and the 
           basic concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and 
           polymorphism all can be represented using UML.</p>

        <p>UML is powerful enough to represent all the concepts that exist in 
           object-oriented analysis and design. UML diagrams are representation 
           of object-oriented concepts only. Thus, before learning UML, it 
           becomes important to understand OO concept in detail.</p>

        <p>Following are some fundamental concepts of the object-oriented 
           world:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Objects − Objects represent an entity and the basic building 
                        block.</li>
          <li>Class − Class is the blue print of an object.</li>
          <li>Abstraction − Abstraction represents the behavior of an real world
                            entity.</li>
          <li>Encapsulation − Encapsulation is the mechanism of binding the data
                              together and hiding them from the outside 
                              world.</li>
          <li>Inheritance − Inheritance is the mechanism of making new classes 
                            from existing ones.</li>
          <li>Polymorphism − It defines the mechanism to exists in different 
                             forms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>OO Analysis and Design</h5>
        <p>OO can be defined as an investigation and to be more specific, it is 
           the investigation of objects. Design means collaboration of 
           identified objects.</p>

        <p>Thus, it is important to understand the OO analysis and design 
           concepts. The most important purpose of OO analysis is to identify 
           objects of a system to be designed. This analysis is also done for 
           an existing system. Now an efficient analysis is only possible when 
           we are able to start thinking in a way where objects can be 
           identified. After identifying the objects, their relationships are 
           identified and finally the design is produced.</p>

        <p>The purpose of OO analysis and design can described as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Identifying the objects of a system.</li>
          <li>Identifying their relationships.</li>
          <li>Making a design, which can be converted to executables using OO 
              languages.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>There are three basic steps where the OO concepts are applied and 
           implemented. The steps can be defined as</p>
        
<pre>
<code>
OO Analysis → OO Design → OO implementation using OO languages
</code>
</pre>        
        
        <p>The above three points can be described in detail as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>During OO analysis, the most important purpose is to identify 
              objects and describe them in a proper way. If these objects are 
              identified efficiently, then the next job of design is easy. The 
              objects should be identified with responsibilities. 
              Responsibilities are the functions performed by the object. Each 
              and every object has some type of responsibilities to be 
              performed. When these responsibilities are collaborated, the 
              purpose of the system is fulfilled.</li>
          <li>The second phase is OO design. During this phase, emphasis is 
              placed on the requirements and their fulfillment. In this stage, 
              the objects are collaborated according to their intended 
              association. After the association is complete, the design is also
              complete.</li>
          <li>The third phase is OO implementation. In this phase, the design is
              implemented using OO languages such as Java, C++, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>Role of UML in OO Design</h5>
        <p>UML is a modeling language used to model software and non-software 
           systems. Although UML is used for non-software systems, the emphasis 
           is on modeling OO software applications. Most of the UML diagrams 
           discussed so far are used to model different aspects such as static, 
           dynamic, etc. Now whatever be the aspect, the artifacts are nothing 
           but objects.</p>

        <p>If we look into class diagram, object diagram, collaboration diagram,
           interaction diagrams all would basically be designed based on the 
           objects.</p>

        <p>Hence, the relation between OO design and UML is very important to 
           understand. The OO design is transformed into UML diagrams according 
           to the requirement. Before understanding the UML in detail, the OO 
           concept should be learned properly. Once the OO analysis and design 
           is done, the next step is very easy. The input from OO analysis and 
           design is the input to UML diagrams.</p>                                         
        
        <a name="basics" id="basics"></a>                                       
        <h4>The Basics</h4>
        <p>As UML describes the real-time systems, it is very important to make 
           a conceptual model and then proceed gradually. The conceptual model 
           of UML can be mastered by learning the following three major 
           elements:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>UML building blocks</li>
          <li>Rules to connect the building blocks</li>
          <li>Common mechanisms of UML</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This chapter describes all the UML building blocks. The building 
           blocks of UML can be defined as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Things</li>
          <li>Relationships</li>
          <li>Diagrams</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Things</h5>
        <p>Things are the most important building blocks of UML. Things can 
           be:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Structural</li>
          <li>Behavioral</li>
          <li>Grouping</li>
          <li>Annotational</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Structural Things</h5>
        <p>Structural things define the static part of the model. They represent
           the physical and conceptual elements. Following are the brief 
           descriptions of the structural things.</p>

        <ul>        
          <li>Class − Class represents a set of objects having similar 
                      responsibilities.
        </ul>
        
        <img src="../assets/images/class.png" alt=""/>
        <img src="../assets/images/class1.png" alt=""/>

        <ul>
          <li>Interface − Interface defines a set of operations, which specify 
                          the responsibility of a class.</p>
        </ul>
        
        <img src="../assets/images/interface.png" alt=""/>

        <ul>
          <li>Collaboration − Collaboration defines an interaction between 
                              elements.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <img src="../assets/images/collaboration.png" alt=""/>

        <ul>
          <li>Use case − Use case represents a set of actions performed by a 
                         system for a specific goal.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <img src="../assets/images/useCase.png" alt=""/>

        <ul>
          <li>Component − Component describes the physical part of a 
                          system.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="../assets/images/component.png" alt=""/>

        <ul>
         <li>Node − A node can be defined as a physical element that exists at 
                    run time.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="../assets/images/node.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Behavioral Things</h5>
        <p>A behavioral thing consists of the dynamic parts of UML models. 
            Following are the behavioral things:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Interaction − Interaction is defined as a behavior that consists 
                            of a group of messages exchanged among elements to 
                            accomplish a specific task.</li>
        </ul>
        
<img src="../assets/images/interaction.png" alt=""/>

        <ul>
          <li>State machine − State machine is useful when the state of an 
                              object in its life cycle is important. It defines 
                              the sequence of states an object goes through in 
                              response to events. Events are external factors 
                              responsible for state change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Grouping Things</h5>
        <p>Grouping things can be defined as a mechanism to group elements of a 
           UML model together. There is only one grouping thing available:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Package − Package is the only one grouping thing available for 
                        gathering structural and behavioral things.</li>
        </ul>
        
<img src="../assets/images/package.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Annotational Things</h5>
        <p>Annotational things can be defined as a mechanism to capture remarks,
           descriptions, and comments of UML model elements.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Note - It is the only one Annotational thing available. A note is 
                     used to render comments, constraints, etc. of an UML 
                     element.</li>
        </ul>  

<img src="../assets/images/note.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Relationship</h5>
        <p>Relationship is another most important building block of UML. It 
           shows how the elements are associated with each other and this 
           association describes the functionality of an application.</p>

        <p>There are four kinds of relationships available.</p>

        <h5>Dependency</h5>
        <p>Dependency is a relationship between two things in which change in 
           one element also affects the other.</p>
        
<img src="../assets/images/dependency.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Association</h5>
        <p>Association is basically a set of links that connects the elements 
           of a UML model. It also describes how many objects are taking part 
           in that relationship.</p>

<img src="../assets/images/association.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Generalization</h5>
        <p>Generalization can be defined as a relationship which connects a 
           specialized element with a generalized element. It basically 
           describes the inheritance relationship in the world of objects.</p>

<img src="../assets/images/generalization.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Realization</h5>
        <p>Realization can be defined as a relationship in which two elements 
           are connected. One element describes some responsibility, which is 
           not implemented and the other one implements them. This relationship 
           exists in case of interfaces.</p>

<img src="../assets/images/realization.png" alt=""/>

        <h4>Notations</h4>
        <p>UML is popular for its diagrammatic notations. We all know that UML 
           is for visualizing, specifying, constructing and documenting the 
           components of software and non-software systems. Hence, visualization
           is the most important part which needs to be understood and 
           remembered.</p>

        <p>UML notations are the most important elements in modeling. Efficient 
           and appropriate use of notations is very important for making a 
           complete and meaningful model. The model is useless, unless its 
           purpose is depicted properly.</p>

        <p>Hence, learning notations should be emphasized from the very 
           beginning. Different notations are available for things and 
           relationships. UML diagrams are made using the notations of things 
           and relationships. Extensibility is another important feature which 
           makes UML more powerful and flexible.</p>


        <h5>Structural Things</h5>
        <p>Graphical notations used in structural things are most widely used in
           UML. These are considered as the nouns of UML models. Following are 
           the list of structural things.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Classes</li>
          <li>Object</li>
          <li>Interface</li>
          <li>Collaboration</li>
          <li>Use case</li>
          <li>Active classes</li>
          <li>Components</li>
          <li>Nodes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>Class Notation</h5>
        <p>UML class is represented by the following figure. The diagram is 
           divided into four parts.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The top section is used to name the class.</li>
          <li>The second one is used to show the attributes of the class.</li>
          <li>The third section is used to describe the operations performed by 
              the class.</li>
          <li>The fourth section is optional to show any additional 
              components.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="../assets/images/classNotation.png" alt=""/>

        <p>Classes are used to represent objects. Objects can be anything having
           properties and responsibility.</p>

        <h5>Object Notation</h5>
        <p>The object is represented in the same way as the class. The only 
           difference is the name which is underlined as shown in the following 
           figure.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/objectNotation.png" alt=""/>

        <p>As the object is an actual implementation of a class, which is known 
           as the instance of a class. Hence, it has the same usage as the 
           class.</p>

        <h5>Interface Notation</h5>
        <p>Interface is represented by a circle as shown in the following 
           figure. It has a name which is generally written below the 
           circle.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/interfaceNotation.png" alt=""/>
        
        <p>Interface is used to describe the functionality without 
           implementation. Interface is just like a template where you define 
           different functions, not the implementation. When a class implements 
           the interface, it also implements the functionality as per 
           requirement.</p>

        <h5>Collaboration Notation</h5>
        <p>Collaboration is represented by a dotted eclipse as shown in the 
           following figure. It has a name written inside the eclipse.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/collaborationNotation.png" alt=""/>
        
        <p>Collaboration represents responsibilities. Generally, 
           responsibilities are in a group.</p>

        <h5>Use Case Notation</h5>
        <p>Use case is represented as an eclipse with a name inside it. It may 
           contain additional responsibilities.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/useCaseNotation.png" alt=""/>

        <p>Use case is used to capture high level functionalities of a 
           system.</p>

        <h5>Actor Notation</h5>
        <p>An actor can be defined as some internal or external entity that 
           interacts with the system.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/actorNotation.png" alt=""/>
        
        <p>An actor is used in a use case diagram to describe the internal or 
           external entities.</p>

        <h5>Initial and Final state Notation</h5>
        <p>Initial state is defined to show the start of a process. This 
           notation is used in almost all diagrams. The usage of Initial 
           State Notation is to show the starting point of a process.</p>
        
        <img src="../assets/images/stateNotation.png" alt=""/>

        <p>Final state is used to show the end of a process. This notation is 
           also used in almost all diagrams to describe the end. The usage of 
           Final State Notation is to show the termination point of a 
           process.</p>

        <h5>Active Class Notation</h5>
        <p>Active class looks similar to a class with a solid border. Active 
           class is generally used to describe the concurrent behavior of a 
           system.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/activeClassNotation.png" alt=""/>

        <p>Active class is used to represent the concurrency in a system.</p>

        <h5>Component Notation</h5>
        <p>A component in UML is shown in the following figure with a name 
           inside. Additional elements can be added wherever required.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/componentNotation.png" alt=""/>

        <p>Component is used to represent any part of a system for which UML 
           diagrams are made.</p>

        <h5>Node Notation</h5>
        <p>A node in UML is represented by a square box as shown in the 
           following figure with a name. A node represents the physical 
           component of the system.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/nodeNotation.png" alt=""/>
        
        <p>Node is used to represent the physical part of a system such as the 
           server, network, etc.</p>

        <h4>Behavioral Things</h4>
        <p>Dynamic parts are one of the most important elements in UML. UML has 
           a set of powerful features to represent the dynamic part of software 
           and non-software systems. These features include interactions and 
           state machines.</p>

        <p>Interactions can be of two types:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Sequential (Represented by sequence diagram)</li>
          <li>Collaborative (Represented by collaboration diagram)</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h5>Interaction Notation</h5>
        <p>Interaction is basically a message exchange between two UML 
           components. The following diagram represents different notations 
           used in an interaction.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/interactionNotation.png" alt=""/>

        <p>Interaction is used to represent the communication among the 
           components of a system.</p>

        <h5>State Machine Notation</h5>
        <p>State machine describes the different states of a component in its 
           life cycle. The notations are described in the following diagram.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/stateMachineNotation.png" alt=""/>

        <p>State machine is used to describe different states of a system 
           component. The state can be active, idle, or any other depending 
           upon the situation.</p>


        <h5>Grouping Things</h5>
        <p>Organizing the UML models is one of the most important aspects of 
           the design. In UML, there is only one element available for grouping 
           and that is package.</p>

        <h5>Package Notation</h5>
        <p>Package notation is shown in the following figure and is used to 
           wrap the components of a system.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/packageNotation.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Annotational Things</h5>
        <p>In any diagram, explanation of different elements and their 
           functionalities are very important. Hence, UML has notes notation 
           to support this requirement.</p>

        <h5>Note Notation</h5>
        <p>This notation is shown in the following figure. These notations are 
           used to provide necessary information of a system.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/noteNotation.png" alt=""/>
        
        <h5>Relationships</h5>
        <p>A model is not complete unless the relationships between elements 
           are described properly. The Relationship gives a proper meaning to a 
           UML model. Following are the different types of relationships 
           available in UML.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Dependency</li>
          <li>Association</li>
          <li>Generalization</li>
          <li>Extensibility</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Dependency Notation</h5>

        <p>Dependency is an important aspect in UML elements. It describes the 
           dependent elements and the direction of dependency.</p>
        
        <p>Dependency is represented by a dotted arrow as shown in the 
           following figure. The arrow head represents the independent element 
           and the other end represents the dependent element.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/dependecyNotation.png" alt=""/>              
        
        <p>Dependency is used to represent the dependency between two elements 
            of a system</p>

        <h5>Association Notation</h5>
        <p>Association describes how the elements in a UML diagram are 
           associated. In simple words, it describes how many elements are 
           taking part in an interaction.</p>

        <p>Association is represented by a dotted line with (without) arrows on 
           both sides. The two ends represent two associated elements as shown 
           in the following figure. The multiplicity is also mentioned at the 
           ends (1, *, etc.) to show how many objects are associated.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/associationNotation.png" alt=""/>

        <p>Association is used to represent the relationship between two 
           elements of a system.</p>

        <h5>Generalization Notation</h5>
        <p>Generalization describes the inheritance relationship of the 
           object-oriented world. It is a parent and child relationship.</p>

        <p>Generalization is represented by an arrow with a hollow arrow head 
           as shown in the following figure. One end represents the parent 
           element and the other end represents the child element.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/generalizationNotation.png" alt=""/>

        <p>Generalization is used to describe parent-child relationship of two 
           elements of a system.</p>

        <h5>Extensibility Notation</h5>
        <p>All the languages (programming or modeling) have some mechanism to 
           extend its capabilities such as syntax, semantics, etc. UML also has 
           the following mechanisms to provide extensibility features.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Stereotypes (Represents new elements)</li>
          <li>Tagged values (Represents new attributes)</li>
          <li>Constraints (Represents the boundaries)</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="../assets/images/extensibilityNotation.png" alt=""/>
        
        <p>Extensibility notations are used to enhance the power of the 
           language. It is basically additional elements used to represent 
           some extra behavior of the system. These extra behaviors are not 
           covered by the standard available notations.</p>

        <h5>UML Diagrams</h5>
        <p>UML diagrams are the ultimate output of the entire discussion. All 
           the elements, relationships are used to make a complete UML diagram 
           and the diagram represents a system.</p>

        <p>The visual effect of the UML diagram is the most important part of 
           the entire process. All the other elements are used to make it 
           complete.</p>

        <p>UML includes the following nine diagrams, the details of which are 
           described in the subsequent chapters.</p>

        <ul>        
          <li>Class diagram</li>
          <li>Object diagram</li>
          <li>Use case diagram</li>
          <li>Sequence diagram</li>
          <li>Collaboration diagram</li>
          <li>Activity diagram</li>
          <li>Statechart diagram</li>
          <li>Deployment diagram</li>
          <li>Component diagram</li>
        </ul>        

        <h5>Architecture</h5>
        <p>Any real-world system is used by different users. The users can be 
           developers, testers, business people, analysts, and many more. Hence, 
           before designing a system, the architecture is made with different 
           perspectives in mind. The most important part is to visualize the 
           system from the perspective of different viewers. The better we 
           understand the better we can build the system.</p>

        <p>UML plays an important role in defining different perspectives of a 
           system. These perspectives are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Design</li>
          <li>Implementation</li>
          <li>Process</li>
          <li>Deployment</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The center is the Use Case view which connects all these four. A Use 
           Case represents the functionality of the system. Hence, other 
           perspectives are connected with use case.</p>

        <p>Design of a system consists of classes, interfaces, and 
           collaboration. UML provides class diagram, object diagram to support
           this.</p>

        <p>Implementation defines the components assembled together to make a 
           complete physical system. UML component diagram is used to support 
           the implementation perspective.</p>

        <p>Process defines the flow of the system. Hence, the same elements as 
           used in Design are also used to support this perspective.</p>

        <p>Deployment represents the physical nodes of the system that forms 
           the hardware. UML deployment diagram is used to support this 
           perspective.</p>
        
        <h5>Modeling Types</h5>
        <p>It is very important to distinguish between the UML model. Different 
           diagrams are used for different types of UML modeling. There are 
           three important types of UML modeling.</p>

        <h5>Structural Modeling</h5>
        <p>Structural modeling captures the static features of a system. They consist of
           the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Classes diagrams</li>
          <li>Objects diagrams</li>
          <li>Deployment diagrams</li>
          <li>Package diagrams</li>
          <li>Composite structure diagram</li>
          <li>Component diagram</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Structural model represents the framework for the system and this 
           framework is the place where all other components exist. Hence, the 
           class diagram, component diagram and deployment diagrams are part of 
           structural modeling. They all represent the elements and the 
           mechanism to assemble them.</p>

        <p>The structural model never describes the dynamic behavior of the 
           system. Class diagram is the most widely used structural diagram.</p>

        <h5>Behavioral Modeling</h5>
        <p>Behavioral model describes the interaction in the system. It 
           represents the interaction among the structural diagrams. Behavioral 
           modeling shows the dynamic nature of the system. They consist of the 
           following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Activity diagrams</li>
          <li>Interaction diagrams</li>
          <li>Use case diagrams</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All the above show the dynamic sequence of flow in a system.</p>

        <h5>Architectural Modeling</h5>
        <p>Architectural model represents the overall framework of the system. 
           It contains both structural and behavioral elements of the system. 
           Architectural model can be defined as the blueprint of the entire 
           system. Package diagram comes under architectural modeling.</p>

        <a name="standard" id="standard"></a>
        <h4>Standard Diagrams</h4>

        <p>The elements are like components which can be associated in different
           ways to make a complete UML picture, which is known as diagram. Thus,
           it is very important to understand the different diagrams to 
           implement the knowledge in real-life systems.</p>

        <p>Any complex system is best understood by making some kind of diagrams
           or pictures. These diagrams have a better impact on our 
           understanding. If we look around, we will realize that the diagrams 
           are not a new concept but it is used widely in different forms in 
           different industries.</p>

        <p>We prepare UML diagrams to understand the system in a better and 
           simple way. A single diagram is not enough to cover all the aspects 
           of the system. UML defines various kinds of diagrams to cover most 
           of the aspects of a system.</p>

        <p>You can also create your own set of diagrams to meet your 
           requirements. Diagrams are generally made in an incremental and 
           iterative way.</p>

        <p>There are two broad categories of diagrams and they are again divided
            into subcategories:</p>

        <ul>    
          <li>Structural Diagrams</li>
          <li>Behavioral Diagrams</li>
        </ul>

        
        
        
        <h4>Structural Diagrams</h4>
        <p>The structural diagrams represent the static aspect of the system. 
           These static aspects represent those parts of a diagram, which forms 
           the main structure and are therefore stable.</p>
        <p>These static parts are represented by classes, interfaces, objects, 
           components, and nodes. The four structural diagrams are:</p>

        <ul>        
          <li>Class diagram</li>
          <li>Object diagram</li>
          <li>Component diagram</li>
          <li>Deployment diagram</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Class Diagram</h5>
        <p>Class diagrams are the most common diagrams used in UML. Class 
           diagram consists of classes, interfaces, associations, and 
           collaboration. Class diagrams basically represent the object-oriented 
           view of a system, which is static in nature.</p>

        <p>Active class is used in a class diagram to represent the concurrency 
            of the system.</p>

        <p>Class diagram represents the object orientation of a system. Hence, 
           it is generally used for development purpose. This is the most widely 
           used diagram at the time of system construction.</p>

        <p>Class diagram is a static diagram. It represents the static view of 
           an application. Class diagram is not only used for visualizing, 
           describing, and documenting different aspects of a system but also 
           for constructing executable code of the software application.</p>

        <p>Class diagram describes the attributes and operations of a class and 
           also the constraints imposed on the system. The class diagrams are 
           widely used in the modeling of object oriented systems because they 
           are the only UML diagrams, which can be mapped directly with 
           object-oriented languages.</p>

        <p>Class diagram shows a collection of classes, interfaces, 
           associations, collaborations, and constraints. It is also known as a 
           structural diagram.</p>


        <h5>Purpose of Class Diagrams</h5>
        <p>The purpose of class diagram is to model the static view of an 
           application. Class diagrams are the only diagrams which can be 
           directly mapped with object-oriented languages and thus widely used 
           at the time of construction.</p>

        <p>UML diagrams like activity diagram, sequence diagram can only give 
           the sequence flow of the application, however class diagram is a bit 
           different. It is the most popular UML diagram in the coder 
           community.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the class diagram can be summarized as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Analysis and design of the static view of an application.</li>
          <li>Describe responsibilities of a system.</li>
          <li>Base for component and deployment diagrams.</li>
          <li>Forward and reverse engineering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>How to Draw a Class Diagram?</h5>
        <p>Class diagrams are the most popular UML diagrams used for 
           construction of software applications. It is very important 
           to learn the drawing procedure of class diagram.</p>

        <p>Class diagrams have a lot of properties to consider while drawing 
           but here the diagram will be considered from a top level view.</p>

        <p>Class diagram is basically a graphical representation of the static 
           view of the system and represents different aspects of the 
           application. A collection of class diagrams represent the whole 
           system.</p>

        <p>The following points should be remembered while drawing a class 
           diagram:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The name of the class diagram should be meaningful to describe 
              the aspect of the system.</li>
          <li>Each element and their relationships should be identified in 
              advance.</li>
          <li>Responsibility (attributes and methods) of each class should be 
              clearly identified</li>
          <li>For each class, minimum number of properties should be specified, 
              as unnecessary properties will make the diagram complicated.</li>
          <li>Use notes whenever required to describe some aspect of the 
              diagram. At the end of the drawing it should be understandable to 
              the developer/coder.</li>
          <li>Finally, before making the final version, the diagram should be 
              drawn on plain paper and reworked as many times as possible to 
              make it correct.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following diagram is an example of an Order System of an 
           application. It describes a particular aspect of the entire 
           application.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>First of all, Order and Customer are identified as the two 
              elements of the system. They have a one-to-many relationship 
              because a customer can have multiple orders.</li>
          <li>Order class is an abstract class and it has two concrete classes 
              (inheritance relationship) SpecialOrder and NormalOrder.</li>
          <li>The two inherited classes have all the properties as the Order 
              class. In addition, they have additional functions like dispatch()
              and receive().</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following class diagram has been drawn considering all the points 
            mentioned above.</p>

        <h5>Where to Use Class Diagrams?</h5>
        <p>Class diagram is a static diagram and it is used to model the static 
           view of a system. The static view describes the vocabulary of the 
           system.</p>

        <p>Class diagram is also considered as the foundation for component and 
           deployment diagrams. Class diagrams are not only used to visualize 
           the static view of the system but they are also used to construct 
           the executable code for forward and reverse engineering of any 
           system.</p>

        <p>Generally, UML diagrams are not directly mapped with any 
           object-oriented programming languages but the class diagram is an 
           exception.</p>

        <p>Class diagram clearly shows the mapping with object-oriented 
           languages such as Java, C++, etc. From practical experience, class 
           diagram is generally used for construction purpose.</p>

        <p>In a nutshell it can be said, class diagrams are used for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Describing the static view of the system.</li>
          <li>Showing the collaboration among the elements of the static 
              view.</li>
          <li>Describing the functionalities performed by the system.</li>
          <li>Construction of software applications using object oriented 
              languages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Object Diagram</h5>
        <p>Object diagrams can be described as an instance of class diagram. 
            Thus, these diagrams are more close to real-life scenarios where we 
            implement a system.</p>

        <p>Object diagrams are a set of objects and their relationship is just 
            like class diagrams. They also represent the static view of the 
            system.</p>

        <p>The usage of object diagrams is similar to class diagrams but they 
            are used to build prototype of a system from a practical 
            perspective.</p>

        <p>Object diagrams are derived from class diagrams so object diagrams 
           are dependent upon class diagrams.</p>

        <p>Object diagrams represent an instance of a class diagram. The basic 
           concepts are similar for class diagrams and object diagrams. Object 
           diagrams also represent the static view of a system but this static 
           view is a snapshot of the system at a particular moment.</p>

        <p>Object diagrams are used to render a set of objects and their 
           relationships as an instance.</p>

        <h5>Purpose of Object Diagrams</h5>
        <p>The purpose of a diagram should be understood clearly to implement 
           it practically. The purposes of object diagrams are similar to class 
           diagrams.</p>

        <p>The difference is that a class diagram represents an abstract model 
           consisting of classes and their relationships. However, an object 
           diagram represents an instance at a particular moment, which is 
           concrete in nature.</p>

        <p>It means the object diagram is closer to the actual system behavior. 
           The purpose is to capture the static view of a system at a particular
           moment.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the object diagram can be summarized as:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Forward and reverse engineering.</li>
          <li>Object relationships of a system</li>
          <li>Static view of an interaction.</li>
          <li>Understand object behavior and their relationship from practical 
              perspective</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>How to Draw an Object Diagram?</h5>
        <p>We have already discussed that an object diagram is an instance of a 
           class diagram. It implies that an object diagram consists of 
           instances of things used in a class diagram.</p>

        <p>So both diagrams are made of same basic elements but in different 
           form. In class diagram elements are in abstract form to represent 
           the blue print and in object diagram the elements are in concrete 
           form to represent the real world object.</p>

        <p>To capture a particular system, numbers of class diagrams are 
           limited. However, if we consider object diagrams then we can have 
           unlimited number of instances, which are unique in nature. Only 
           those instances are considered, which have an impact on the 
           system.</p>

        <p>From the above discussion, it is clear that a single object diagram 
           cannot capture all the necessary instances or rather cannot specify 
           all the objects of a system. Hence, the solution is:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>First, analyze the system and decide which instances have 
              important data and association.</li>
          <li>Second, consider only those instances, which will cover the 
              functionality.</li>
          <li>Third, make some optimization as the number of instances are 
              unlimited.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Before drawing an object diagram, the following things should be 
            remembered and understood clearly:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Object diagrams consist of objects.</li>
          <li>The link in object diagram is used to connect objects.</li>
          <li>Objects and links are the two elements used to construct an 
              object diagram.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After this, the following things are to be decided before starting 
           the construction of the diagram:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The object diagram should have a meaningful name to indicate its 
              purpose.</li>
          <li>The most important elements are to be identified.</li>
          <li>The association among objects should be clarified.</li>
          <li>Values of different elements need to be captured to include in 
              the object diagram.</li>
          <li>Add proper notes at points where more clarity is required.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following diagram is an example of an object diagram. It 
           represents the Order management system which we have discussed 
           in the chapter Class Diagram. The following diagram is an instance 
           of the system at a particular time of purchase. It has the following 
           objects.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Customer</li>
          <li>Order</li>
          <li>SpecialOrder</li>
          <li>NormalOrder</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now the customer object (C) is associated with three order objects 
           (O1, O2, and O3). These order objects are associated with special 
           order and normal order objects (S1, S2, and N1). The customer has 
           the following three orders with different numbers (12, 32 and 40) 
           for the particular time considered.</p>

        <p>The customer can increase the number of orders in future and in that 
           scenario the object diagram will reflect that. If order, special
           order, and normal order objects are observed then you will find that 
           they have some values.</p>

        <p>For orders, the values are 12, 32, and 40 which implies that the 
           objects have these values for a particular moment (here the 
           particular time when the purchase is made is considered as the 
           moment) when the instance is captured</p>

        <p>The same is true for special order and normal order objects which 
           have number of orders as 20, 30, and 60. If a different time of 
           purchase is considered, then these values will change 
           accordingly.</p>

        <p>The following object diagram has been drawn considering all the 
           points mentioned above</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/objectDiagram.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Where to Use Object Diagrams?</h5>
        <p>Object diagrams can be imagined as the snapshot of a running system 
           at a particular moment. Let us consider an example of a running 
           train</p>

        <p>Now, if you take a snap of the running train then you will find a 
           static picture of it having the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A particular state which is running.</li>
          <li>A particular number of passengers. which will change if the snap 
              is taken in a different time</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here, we can imagine the snap of the running train is an object 
           having the above values. And this is true for any real-life simple 
           or complex system.</p>

        <p>In a nutshell, it can be said that object diagrams are used for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Making the prototype of a system.</li>
          <li>Reverse engineering.</li>
          <li>Modeling complex data structures.</li>
          <li>Understanding the system from practical perspective.</li>
        </ul>

        <a name="component" id="component"></a>    
        <h5>Component Diagram</h5>
        <p>Component diagrams represent a set of components and their 
           relationships. These components consist of classes, interfaces, or 
           collaborations. Component diagrams represent the implementation 
           view of a system.</p>

        <p>During the design phase, software artifacts (classes, interfaces, 
           etc.) of a system are arranged in different groups depending upon 
           their relationship. Now, these groups are known as components.</p>

        <p>Finally, it can be said component diagrams are used to visualize the 
            implementation.</p>
        
        <p>Component diagrams are different in terms of nature and behavior. 
           Component diagrams are used to model the physical aspects of a 
           system. Now the question is, what are these physical aspects? 
           Physical aspects are the elements such as executables, libraries, 
           files, documents, etc. which reside in a node.</p>

        <p>Component diagrams are used to visualize the organization and 
           relationships among components in a system. These diagrams are also 
           used to make executable systems.</p>

        <h5>Purpose of Component Diagrams</h5>
        <p>Component diagram is a special kind of diagram in UML. The purpose 
           is also different from all other diagrams discussed so far. It does 
           not describe the functionality of the system but it describes the 
           components used to make those functionalities.</p>

        <p>Thus from that point of view, component diagrams are used to 
           visualize the physical components in a system. These components are 
           libraries, packages, files, etc.</p>

        <p>Component diagrams can also be described as a static implementation 
           view of a system. Static implementation represents the organization 
           of the components at a particular moment.</p>

        <p>A single component diagram cannot represent the entire system but a 
           collection of diagrams is used to represent the whole.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the component diagram can be summarized as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Visualize the components of a system.</li>
          <li>Construct executables by using forward and reverse 
              engineering.</li>
          <li>Describe the organization and relationships of the 
              components.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>How to Draw a Component Diagram?</h5>
        <p>Component diagrams are used to describe the physical artifacts of a 
           system. This artifact includes files, executables, libraries, etc</p>

        <p>The purpose of this diagram is different. Component diagrams are used
           during the implementation phase of an application. However, it is 
           prepared well in advance to visualize the implementation details.</p>

        <p>Initially, the system is designed using different UML diagrams and 
           then when the artifacts are ready, component diagrams are used to get
           an idea of the implementation.</p>

        <p>This diagram is very important as without it the application cannot 
           be implemented efficiently. A well-prepared component diagram is also 
           important for other aspects such as application performance, 
           maintenance, etc.</p>

        <p>Before drawing a component diagram, the following artifacts are to 
           be identified clearly:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Files used in the system.</li>
          <li>Libraries and other artifacts relevant to the application.</li>
          <li>Relationships among the artifacts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After identifying the artifacts, the following points need to be 
           kept in mind.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Use a meaningful name to identify the component for which the 
              diagram is to be drawn.</li>
          <li>Prepare a mental layout before producing the using tools.</li>
          <li>Use notes for clarifying important points.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Following is a component diagram for order management system. Here, 
           the artifacts are files. The diagram shows the files in the 
           application and their relationships. In actual, the component 
           diagram also contains dlls, libraries, folders, etc.</p>

        <p>In the following diagram, four files are identified and their 
           relationships are produced. Component diagram cannot be matched 
           directly with other UML diagrams discussed so far as it is drawn for 
           completely different purpose.</p>

        <p>The following component diagram has been drawn considering all the 
           points mentioned above.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/componentDiagram.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Where to Use Component Diagrams?</h5>
        <p>We have already described that component diagrams are used to 
           visualize the static implementation view of a system. Component 
           diagrams are special type of UML diagrams used for different 
           purposes.</p>

        <p>These diagrams show the physical components of a system. To clarify 
            it, we can say that component diagrams describe the organization of 
            the components in a system.</p>

        <p>Organization can be further described as the location of the 
            components in a system. These components are organized in a special 
            way to meet the system requirements.</p>

        <p>As we have already discussed, those components are libraries, files, 
            executables, etc. Before implementing the application, these 
            components are to be organized. This component organization is also 
            designed separately as a part of project execution.</p>

        <p>Component diagrams are very important from implementation 
            perspective. Thus, the implementation team of an application 
            should have a proper knowledge of the component details</p>

        <p>Component diagrams can be used to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Model the components of a system.</li>
          <li>Model the database schema.</li>
          <li>Model the executables of an application.</li>
          <li>Model the system's source code.</li>
        </ul>

        <a name="deployment" id="deployment"></a>
        <h5>Deployment Diagram</h5>
        <p>Deployment diagrams are a set of nodes and their relationships. These
            nodes are physical entities where the components are deployed.</p>

        <p>Deployment diagrams are used for visualizing the deployment view of 
            a system. This is generally used by the deployment team.</p>

        <p>Note: If the above descriptions and usages are observed carefully 
            then it is very clear that all the diagrams have some relationship 
            with one another. Component diagrams are dependent upon the classes,
            interfaces, etc. which are part of class/object diagram. Again, the 
            deployment diagram is dependent upon the components, which are used 
            to make component diagrams.</p>
        
        <p>Deployment diagrams are used to visualize the topology of the 
           physical components of a system, where the software components are 
           deployed.</p>

        <p>Deployment diagrams are used to describe the static deployment view 
           of a system. Deployment diagrams consist of nodes and their 
           relationships.</p>

        <h5>Purpose of Deployment Diagrams</h5>
        <p>The term Deployment itself describes the purpose of the diagram. 
           Deployment diagrams are used for describing the hardware components, 
           where software components are deployed. Component diagrams and 
           deployment diagrams are closely related.</p>

        <p>Component diagrams are used to describe the components and deployment
           diagrams shows how they are deployed in hardware.</p>

        <p>UML is mainly designed to focus on the software artifacts of a 
           system. However, these two diagrams are special diagrams used to 
           focus on software and hardware components.</p>

        <p>Most of the UML diagrams are used to handle logical components but 
           deployment diagrams are made to focus on the hardware topology of a 
           system. Deployment diagrams are used by the system engineers.</p>

        <p>The purpose of deployment diagrams can be described as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Visualize the hardware topology of a system.</li>
          <li>Describe the hardware components used to deploy software 
              components.</li>
          <li>Describe the runtime processing nodes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>How to Draw a Deployment Diagram?</h5>
        <p>Deployment diagram represents the deployment view of a system. It is 
           related to the component diagram because the components are deployed 
           using the deployment diagrams. A deployment diagram consists of 
           nodes. Nodes are nothing but physical hardware used to deploy the 
           application.</p>

        <p>Deployment diagrams are useful for system engineers. An efficient 
           deployment diagram is very important as it controls the following 
           parameters:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Performance</li>
          <li>Scalability</li>
          <li>Maintainability</li>
          <li>Portability</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Before drawing a deployment diagram, the following artifacts should 
           be identified:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Nodes</li>
          <li>Relationships among nodes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Following is a sample deployment diagram to provide an idea of the 
           deployment view of order management system. Here, we have shown 
           nodes as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Monitor</li>
          <li>Modem</li>
          <li>Caching server</li>
          <li>Server</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The application is assumed to be a web-based application, which is 
           deployed in a clustered environment using server 1, server 2, and 
           server 3. The user connects to the application using the Internet. 
           The control flows from the caching server to the clustered 
           environment.</p>

        <p>The following deployment diagram has been drawn considering all the 
            points mentioned above.</p>

        <h5>Where to Use Deployment Diagrams?</h5>
        <p>Deployment diagrams are mainly used by system engineers. These 
           diagrams are used to describe the physical components (hardware), 
           their distribution, and association.</p>

        <p>Deployment diagrams can be visualized as the hardware 
           components/nodes on which the software components reside.</p>

        <p>Software applications are developed to model complex business 
           processes. Efficient software applications are not sufficient to 
           meet the business requirements. Business requirements can be 
           described as the need to support the increasing number of users, 
           quick response time, etc.</p>

        <p>To meet these types of requirements, hardware components should be 
            designed efficiently and in a cost-effective way.</p>

        <p>Now-a-days software applications are very complex in nature. Software
           applications can be standalone, web-based, distributed, 
           mainframe-based and many more. Hence, it is very important to design 
           the hardware components efficiently.</p>

        <p>Deployment diagrams can be used:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>To model the hardware topology of a system.</li>
          <li>To model the embedded system.</li>
          <li>To model the hardware details for a client/server system.</li>
          <li>To model the hardware details of a distributed application.</li>
          <li>For Forward and Reverse engineering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Behavioral Diagrams</h4>
        <p>Any system can have two aspects, static and dynamic. So, a model is 
           considered as complete when both the aspects are fully covered.</p>

        <p>Behavioral diagrams basically capture the dynamic aspect of a system.
           Dynamic aspect can be further described as the changing/moving parts 
           of a system. UML has the following five types of behavioral 
           diagrams:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Use case diagram</li>
          <li>Sequence diagram</li>
          <li>Collaboration diagram</li>
          <li>Statechart diagram</li>
          <li>Activity diagram</li>
        </ul>

        <a name="use" id="use"></a>
        <h5>Use Case Diagram</h5>
        <p>Use case diagrams are a set of use cases, actors, and their 
           relationships. They represent the use case view of a system.</p>

        <p>A use case represents a particular functionality of a system. Hence, 
           use case diagram is used to describe the relationships among the 
           functionalities and their internal/external controllers. These 
           controllers are known as actors.</p>
        
        <p>To model a system, the most important aspect is to capture the 
           dynamic behavior. Dynamic behavior means the behavior of the system 
           when it is running/operating.</p>

        <p>Only static behavior is not sufficient to model a system rather 
           dynamic behavior is more important than static behavior. In UML, 
           there are five diagrams available to model the dynamic nature and 
           use case diagram is one of them. Now as we have to discuss that the 
           use case diagram is dynamic in nature, there should be some internal 
           or external factors for making the interaction.</p>

        <p>These internal and external agents are known as actors. Use case 
           diagrams consists of actors, use cases and their relationships. The 
           diagram is used to model the system/subsystem of an application. A 
           single use case diagram captures a particular functionality of a 
           system.</p>

        <p>Hence to model the entire system, a number of use case diagrams are 
           used.</p>

        <h5>Purpose of Use Case Diagrams</h5>
        <p>The purpose of use case diagram is to capture the dynamic aspect of 
           a system. However, this definition is too generic to describe the 
           purpose, as other four diagrams (activity, sequence, collaboration, 
           and Statechart) also have the same purpose. We will look into some 
           specific purpose, which will distinguish it from other four 
           diagrams.</p>

        <p>Use case diagrams are used to gather the requirements of a system 
           including internal and external influences. These requirements are 
           mostly design requirements. Hence, when a system is analyzed to 
           gather its functionalities, use cases are prepared and actors are 
           identified.</p>

        <p>When the initial task is complete, use case diagrams are modeled to 
           present the outside view.</p>
        
        <p>In brief, the purposes of use case diagrams can be said to be as 
            follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Used to gather the requirements of a system.</li>
          <li>Used to get an outside view of a system.</li>
          <li>Identify the external and internal factors influencing the 
              system.</li>
          <li>Show the interaction among the requirements are actors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>How to Draw a Use Case Diagram?</h5>
        <p>Use case diagrams are considered for high level requirement analysis 
           of a system. When the requirements of a system are analyzed, the 
           functionalities are captured in use cases.</p>

        <p>We can say that use cases are nothing but the system functionalities 
           written in an organized manner. The second thing which is relevant to
           use cases are the actors. Actors can be defined as something that 
           interacts with the system.</p>

        <p>Actors can be a human user, some internal applications, or may be 
           some external applications. When we are planning to draw a use case 
           diagram, we should have the following items identified.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Functionalities to be represented as use case</li>
          <li>Actors</li>
          <li>Relationships among the use cases and actors</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Use case diagrams are drawn to capture the functional requirements 
           of a system. After identifying the above items, we have to use the 
           following guidelines to draw an efficient use case diagram</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The name of a use case is very important. The name should be 
              chosen in such a way so that it can identify the functionalities 
              performed.</li>
          <li>Give a suitable name for actors.</li>
          <li>Show relationships and dependencies clearly in the diagram.</li>
          <li>Do not try to include all types of relationships, as the main 
              purpose of the diagram is to identify the requirements.</li>
          <li>Use notes whenever required to clarify some important points.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Following is a sample use case diagram representing the order 
           management system. Hence, if we look into the diagram then we will 
           find three use cases (Order, SpecialOrder, and NormalOrder) and one 
           actor which is the customer.</p>

        <p>The SpecialOrder and NormalOrder use cases are extended from Order 
           use case. Hence, they have extended relationship. Another important 
           point is to identify the system boundary, which is shown in the 
           picture. The actor Customer lies outside the system as it is an 
           external user of the system.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/useCaseDiagram.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Where to Use a Use Case Diagram?</h5>
        <p>As we have already discussed there are five diagrams in UML to model 
           the dynamic view of a system. Now each and every model has some 
           specific purpose to use. Actually these specific purposes are 
           different angles of a running system.</p>

        <p>To understand the dynamics of a system, we need to use different 
           types of diagrams. Use case diagram is one of them and its specific 
           purpose is to gather system requirements and actors.</p>

        <p>Use case diagrams specify the events of a system and their flows. 
           But use case diagram never describes how they are implemented. Use 
           case diagram can be imagined as a black box where only the input, 
           output, and the function of the black box is known.</p>

        <p>These diagrams are used at a very high level of design. This high 
           level design is refined again and again to get a complete and 
           practical picture of the system. A well-structured use case also 
           describes the pre-condition, post condition, and exceptions. These 
           extra elements are used to make test cases when performing the 
           testing.</p>

        <p>Although use case is not a good candidate for forward and reverse 
           engineering, still they are used in a slightly different way to make 
           forward and reverse engineering. The same is true for reverse 
           engineering. Use case diagram is used differently to make it suitable
           for reverse engineering.</p>

        <p>In forward engineering, use case diagrams are used to make test cases
           and in reverse engineering use cases are used to prepare the 
           requirement details from the existing application.</p>

        <p>Use case diagrams can be used for:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Requirement analysis and high level design.</li>
          <li>Model the context of a system.</li>
          <li>Reverse engineering.</li>
          <li>Forward engineering.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr/>
        
        <a name="interaction" id="interaction"></a>
        <h4>Interaction Diagrams</h4>
        <p>From the term Interaction, it is clear that the diagram is used to 
           describe some type of interactions among the different elements in 
           the model. This interaction is a part of dynamic behavior of the 
           system.</p>

        <p>This interactive behavior is represented in UML by two diagrams 
           known as Sequence diagram and Collaboration diagram. The basic 
           purpose of both the diagrams are similar.</p>

        <p>Sequence diagram emphasizes on time sequence of messages and 
           collaboration diagram emphasizes on the structural organization 
           of the objects that send and receive messages.</p>

        <h5>Purpose of Interaction Diagrams</h5>
        <p>The purpose of interaction diagrams is to visualize the interactive 
           behavior of the system. Visualizing the interaction is a difficult 
           task. Hence, the solution is to use different types of models to 
           capture the different aspects of the interaction.</p>

        <p>Sequence and collaboration diagrams are used to capture the dynamic 
           nature but from a different angle. The purpose of interaction 
           diagram is:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>To capture the dynamic behavior of a system.</li>
          <li>To describe the message flow in the system.</li>
          <li>To describe the structural organization of the objects.</li>
          <li>To describe the interaction among objects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>How to Draw an Interaction Diagram?</h5>
        <p>As we have already discussed, the purpose of interaction diagrams is 
           to capture the dynamic aspect of a system. So to capture the dynamic 
           aspect, we need to understand what a dynamic aspect is and how it is 
           visualized. Dynamic aspect can be defined as the snapshot of the 
           running system at a particular moment</p>

        <p>We have two types of interaction diagrams in UML. One is the sequence 
           diagram and the other is the collaboration diagram. The sequence 
           diagram captures the time sequence of the message flow from one 
           object to another and the collaboration diagram describes the 
           organization of objects in a system taking part in the message 
           flow.</p>

        <p>Following things are to be identified clearly before drawing the 
           interaction diagram</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Objects taking part in the interaction.</li>
          <li>Message flows among the objects.</li>
          <li>The sequence in which the messages are flowing.</li>
          <li>Object organization.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Following are two interaction diagrams modeling the order management 
           system. The first diagram is a sequence diagram and the second is a 
           collaboration diagram</p>
                
        <a name="sequence" id="sequence"></a>
        <h5>Sequence Diagram</h5>
        <p>A sequence diagram is an interaction diagram. From the name, it is 
           clear that the diagram deals with some sequences, which are the 
           sequence of messages flowing from one object to another.</p>

        <p>Interaction among the components of a system is very important from 
           implementation and execution perspective. Sequence diagram is used 
           to visualize the sequence of calls in a system to perform a specific 
           functionality.</p>
        
        <p>The sequence diagram has four objects (Customer, Order, SpecialOrder 
            and NormalOrder).</p>

        <p>The following diagram shows the message sequence for SpecialOrder 
           object and the same can be used in case of NormalOrder object. It 
           is important to understand the time sequence of message flows. The 
           message flow is nothing but a method call of an object.</p>

        <p>The first call is sendOrder () which is a method of Order object. The
           next call is confirm () which is a method of SpecialOrder object and 
           the last call is Dispatch () which is a method of SpecialOrder 
           object. The following diagram mainly describes the method calls from 
           one object to another, and this is also the actual scenario when the 
           system is running.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/sequenceDiagram.png" alt=""/>
        
        
        <a name="collaboration" id="collaboration"></a>
        <h5>Collaboration Diagram</h5>
        <p>Collaboration diagram is another form of interaction diagram. It 
           represents the structural organization of a system and the messages 
           sent/received. Structural organization consists of objects and 
           links.</p>

        <p>The purpose of collaboration diagram is similar to sequence diagram. 
           However, the specific purpose of collaboration diagram is to 
           visualize the organization of objects and their interaction.</p>

        <p>The second interaction diagram is the collaboration diagram. It 
           shows the object organization as seen in the following diagram. In 
           the collaboration diagram, the method call sequence is indicated by 
           some numbering technique. The number indicates how the methods are 
           called one after another. We have taken the same order management 
           system to describe the collaboration diagram.</p>

        <p>Method calls are similar to that of a sequence diagram. However, 
           difference being the sequence diagram does not describe the object 
           organization, whereas the collaboration diagram shows the object 
           organization.</p>
    
        <p>To choose between these two diagrams, emphasis is placed on the type 
           of requirement. If the time sequence is important, then the sequence 
           diagram is used. If organization is required, then collaboration 
           diagram is used.</p>

<img src="../assets/images/collaborationDiagram.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Where to Use Interaction Diagrams?</h5>
        <p>We have already discussed that interaction diagrams are used to 
           describe the dynamic nature of a system. Now, we will look into the 
           practical scenarios where these diagrams are used. To understand the 
           practical application, we need to understand the basic nature of 
           sequence and collaboration diagram.</p>

        <p>The main purpose of both the diagrams are similar as they are used 
           to capture the dynamic behavior of a system. However, the specific 
           purpose is more important to clarify and understand.</p>

        <p>Sequence diagrams are used to capture the order of messages flowing 
           from one object to another. Collaboration diagrams are used to 
           describe the structural organization of the objects taking part in 
           the interaction. A single diagram is not sufficient to describe the 
           dynamic aspect of an entire system, so a set of diagrams are used to 
           capture it as a whole.</p>

        <p>Interaction diagrams are used when we want to understand the message 
           flow and the structural organization. Message flow means the sequence 
           of control flow from one object to another. Structural organization 
           means the visual organization of the elements in a system.</p>

        <p>Interaction diagrams can be used:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>To model the flow of control by time sequence.</li>
          <li>To model the flow of control by structural organizations.</li>
          <li>For forward engineering.</li>
          <li>For reverse engineering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Statechart Diagram</h5>
        <p>Any real-time system is expected to be reacted by some kind of 
           internal/external events. These events are responsible for state 
           change of the system.</p>

        <p>Statechart diagram is used to represent the event driven state 
           change of a system. It basically describes the state change of a 
           class, interface, etc.</p>

        <p>State chart diagram is used to visualize the reaction of a system by 
           internal/external factors.</p>

        <p>The name of the diagram itself clarifies the purpose of the diagram 
           and other details. It describes different states of a component in a 
           system. The states are specific to a component/object of a 
           system.</p>

        <p>A Statechart diagram describes a state machine. State machine can be 
           defined as a machine which defines different states of an object and 
           these states are controlled by external or internal events.</p>

        <p>Activity diagram explained in the next chapter, is a special kind of 
           a Statechart diagram. As Statechart diagram defines the states, it is
           used to model the lifetime of an object.</p>

        <h5>Purpose of Statechart Diagrams</h5>
        
        <p>Statechart diagram is one of the five UML diagrams used to model the 
           dynamic nature of a system. They define different states of an object 
           during its lifetime and these states are changed by events. 
           Statechart diagrams are useful to model the reactive systems. 
           Reactive systems can be defined as a system that responds to 
           external or internal events.</p>

        <p>Statechart diagram describes the flow of control from one state to 
           another state. States are defined as a condition in which an object 
           exists and it changes when some event is triggered. The most 
           important purpose of Statechart diagram is to model lifetime of an 
           object from creation to termination.</p>

        <p>Statechart diagrams are also used for forward and reverse engineering
           of a system. However, the main purpose is to model the reactive 
           system.</p>

        <p>Following are the main purposes of using Statechart diagrams:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>To model the dynamic aspect of a system.</li>
          <li>To model the life time of a reactive system.</li>
          <li>To describe different states of an object during its life 
              time.</li>
          <li>Define a state machine to model the states of an object.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>How to Draw a Statechart Diagram?</h5>
        <p>Statechart diagram is used to describe the states of different 
           objects in its life cycle. Emphasis is placed on the state changes 
           upon some internal or external events. These states of objects are 
           important to analyze and implement them accurately.</p>

        <p>Statechart diagrams are very important for describing the states. 
           States can be identified as the condition of objects when a 
           particular event occurs.</p>

        <p>Before drawing a Statechart diagram we should clarify the following 
           points:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Identify the important objects to be analyzed.</li>
          <li>Identify the states.</li>
          <li>Identify the events.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Following is an example of a Statechart diagram where the state of 
            Order object is analyzed</p>

        <p>The first state is an idle state from where the process starts. The 
           next states are arrived for events like send request, confirm 
           request, and dispatch order. These events are responsible for the 
           state changes of order object.</p>

        <p>During the life cycle of an object (here order object) it goes 
           through the following states and there may be some abnormal exits. 
           This abnormal exit may occur due to some problem in the system. When 
           the entire life cycle is complete, it is considered as a complete 
           transaction as shown in the following figure. The initial and final 
           state of an object is also shown in the following figure.</p>

        <h5>Where to Use Statechart Diagrams?</h5>
        <p>From the above discussion, we can define the practical applications 
           of a Statechart diagram. Statechart diagrams are used to model the 
           dynamic aspect of a system like other four diagrams discussed in 
           this tutorial. However, it has some distinguishing characteristics 
           for modeling the dynamic nature.</p>

        <p>Statechart diagram defines the states of a component and these state 
           changes are dynamic in nature. Its specific purpose is to define the 
           state changes triggered by events. Events are internal or external 
           factors influencing the system.</p>

        <p>Statechart diagrams are used to model the states and also the events 
           operating on the system. When implementing a system, it is very 
           important to clarify different states of an object during its life 
           time and Statechart diagrams are used for this purpose. When these 
           states and events are identified, they are used to model it and 
           these models are used during the implementation of the system.</p>

        <p>If we look into the practical implementation of Statechart diagram, 
           then it is mainly used to analyze the object states influenced by 
           events. This analysis is helpful to understand the system behavior 
           during its execution.</p>

        <p>The main usage can be described as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>To model the object states of a system.</li>
          <li>To model the reactive system. Reactive system consists of 
              reactive objects.</li>
          <li>To identify the events responsible for state changes.</li>
          <li>Forward and reverse engineering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Activity Diagram</h5>
        <p>Activity diagram describes the flow of control in a system. It 
           consists of activities and links. The flow can be sequential, 
           concurrent, or branched.</p>

        <p>Activities are nothing but the functions of a system. Numbers of 
           activity diagrams are prepared to capture the entire flow in a 
           system.</p>

        <p>Activity diagrams are used to visualize the flow of controls in a 
           system. This is prepared to have an idea of how the system will work 
           when executed.</p>

        <p>Note: Dynamic nature of a system is very difficult to capture. UML 
           has provided features to capture the dynamics of a system from 
           different angles. Sequence diagrams and collaboration diagrams are 
           isomorphic, hence they can be converted from one another without 
           losing any information. This is also true for Statechart and 
           activity diagram.</p>

        <p>Activity diagram is another important diagram in UML to describe the 
           dynamic aspects of the system.</p>

        <p>Activity diagram is basically a flowchart to represent the flow from 
           one activity to another activity. The activity can be described as 
           an operation of the system.</p>

        <p>The control flow is drawn from one operation to another. This flow 
           can be sequential, branched, or concurrent. Activity diagrams deal 
           with all type of flow control by using different elements such as 
           fork, join, etc</p>

        <h5>Purpose of Activity Diagrams</h5>
        <p>The basic purposes of activity diagrams is similar to other four 
           diagrams. It captures the dynamic behavior of the system. Other 
           four diagrams are used to show the message flow from one object 
           to another but activity diagram is used to show message flow from 
           one activity to another.</p>

        <p>Activity is a particular operation of the system. Activity diagrams 
           are not only used for visualizing the dynamic nature of a system, 
           but they are also used to construct the executable system by using 
           forward and reverse engineering techniques. The only missing thing 
           in the activity diagram is the message part.</p>

        <p>It does not show any message flow from one activity to another. 
           Activity diagram is sometimes considered as the flowchart. Although 
           the diagrams look like a flowchart, they are not. It shows different 
           flows such as parallel, branched, concurrent, and single.</p>


        <p>The purpose of an activity diagram can be described as:</p>

        <ul>
          Draw the activity flow of a system.
          Describe the sequence from one activity to another.
          Describe the parallel, branched and concurrent flow of the system.
        </ul>

        <h5>How to Draw an Activity Diagram?</h5>
        <p>Activity diagrams are mainly used as a flowchart that consists of 
           activities performed by the system. Activity diagrams are not 
           exactly flowcharts as they have some additional capabilities. These 
           additional capabilities include branching, parallel flow, swimlane, 
           etc.</p>

        <p>Before drawing an activity diagram, we must have a clear 
           understanding about the elements used in activity diagram. The main
           element of an activity diagram is the activity itself. An activity 
           is a function performed by the system. After identifying the 
           activities, we need to understand how they are associated with 
           constraints and conditions.</p>

        <p>Before drawing an activity diagram, we should identify the following 
           elements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Activities</li>
          <li>Association</li>
          <li>Conditions</li>
          <li>Constraints</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Once the above-mentioned parameters are identified, we need to make 
           a mental layout of the entire flow. This mental layout is then 
           transformed into an activity diagram.</p>

        <p>Following is an example of an activity diagram for order management 
           system. In the diagram, four activities are identified which are 
           associated with conditions. One important point should be clearly 
           understood that an activity diagram cannot be exactly matched with 
           the code. The activity diagram is made to understand the flow of 
           activities and is mainly used by the business users</p>

        <p>Following diagram is drawn with the four main activities:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Send order by the customer</li>
          <li>Receipt of the order</li>
          <li>Confirm the order</li>
          <li>Dispatch the order</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After receiving the order request, condition checks are performed to 
           check if it is normal or special order. After the type of order is 
           identified, dispatch activity is performed and that is marked as the 
           termination of the process.</p>

        <img src="../assets/images/activityDiagram.png" alt=""/>

        <h5>Where to Use Activity Diagrams?</h5>
        <p>The basic usage of activity diagram is similar to other four UML 
           diagrams. The specific usage is to model the control flow from one 
           activity to another. This control flow does not include messages.</p>

        <p>Activity diagram is suitable for modeling the activity flow of the 
           system. An application can have multiple systems. Activity diagram 
           also captures these systems and describes the flow from one system 
           to another. This specific usage is not available in other diagrams. 
           These systems can be database, external queues, or any other 
           system.</p>

        <p>We will now look into the practical applications of the activity 
           diagram. From the above discussion, it is clear that an activity 
           diagram is drawn from a very high level. So it gives high level 
           view of a system. This high level view is mainly for business users 
           or any other person who is not a technical person.</p>

        <p>This diagram is used to model the activities which are nothing but 
           business requirements. The diagram has more impact on business 
           understanding rather than on implementation details.</p>

        <p>Activity diagram can be used for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Modeling work flow by using activities.</li>
          <li>Modeling business requirements.</li>
          <li>High level understanding of the system's functionalities.</li>
          <li>Investigating business requirements at a later stage.</li>
        </ul>
