        <p>User Experience Design (UXD, UED, or XD) is the process of manipulating
           user behavior with a product by using data to inform the design process 
           and continual updates to the usability, accessibility, and desirability 
           provided in the interaction with a product. User experience design 
           encompasses traditional human–computer interaction (HCI) design and 
           extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as 
           perceived by users. <br/><br/>
           
           Experience design (XD) is the practice of designing 
           products, processes, services, events, omnichannel journeys, and 
           environments with a focus placed on the quality of the user experience 
           and culturally relevant solutions. Experience design is not driven by 
           a single design discipline. Instead, it requires a cross-discipline 
           perspective that considers multiple aspects of the brand/ business/ 
           environment/ experience from product, packaging and retail environment 
           to the clothing and attitude of employees. Experience design seeks to 
           develop the experience of a product, service, or event along any or all 
           of the following dimensions:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Duration (Initiation, Immersion, Conclusion, and Continuation)</li>
        <li>Intensity (Reflex, Habit, Engagement)</li>
        <li>Breadth (Products, Services, Brands, Nomenclatures, Channels/Environment/Promotion, and Price)</li>
        <li>Interaction (Passive < > Active < > Interactive)</li>
        <li>Triggers (All Human Senses, Concepts, and Symbols)</li>
        <li>Significance (Meaning, Status, Emotion, Price, and Function)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>User Interface (UI)</h4>

        <p>The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of human–computer 
           interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines 
           occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and 
           control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine 
           simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' 
           decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces 
           include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, 
           heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design 
           considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or 
           involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology.</p>

        <p>Generally, the goal of user interface design is to produce a user 
           interface which makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) 
           to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result. This 
           generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to 
           achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired 
           outputs to the human.</p>

        <p>User interfaces are composed of one or more layers including a 
           human-machine interface (HMI) interfaces machines with physical input 
           hardware such a keyboards, mice, game pads and output hardware such as 
           computer monitors, speakers, and printers. A device that implements a HMI 
           is called a human interface device (HID). Other terms for human-machine 
           interfaces are man–machine interface (MMI) and when the machine in 
           question is a computer human–computer interface. Additional UI layers may
           interact with one or more human sense, including: tactile UI (touch), 
           visual UI (sight), auditory UI (sound), olfactory UI (smell), equilibrial 
           UI (balance), and gustatory UI (taste).</p>

        <p>Composite user interfaces (CUI) are UIs that interact with two or more 
           senses. The most common CUI is a graphical user interface (GUI), which is 
           composed of a tactile UI and a visual UI capable of displaying graphics. 
           When sound is added to a GUI it becomes a multimedia user interface (MUI).
           There are three broad categories of CUI: standard, virtual and augmented. 
           Standard composite user interfaces use standard human interface devices 
           like keyboards, mice, and computer monitors. When the CUI blocks out the 
           real world to create a virtual reality, the CUI is virtual and uses a 
           virtual reality interface. When the CUI does not block out the real world 
           and creates augmented reality, the CUI is augmented and uses an augmented 
           reality interface. <br/><br/>
           
           When a UI interacts with all human senses, it is 
           called a qualia interface, named after the theory of qualia. CUI may also 
           be classified by how many senses they interact with as either an X-sense 
           virtual reality interface or X-sense augmented reality interface, where 
           X is the number of senses interfaced with. For example, a Smell-O-Vision 
           is a 3-sense (3S) Standard CUI with visual display, sound and smells; 
           when virtual reality interfaces interface with smells and touch it is 
           said to be a 4-sense (4S) virtual reality interface; and when augmented 
           reality interfaces interface with smells and touch it is said to be 
           a 4-sense (4S) augmented reality interface. </p>
