        <h3>Python </h3>
        
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>

        <ul>
         <li><strong>Python is Interpreted</strong> − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
         <li><strong>Python is Interactive</strong> − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
         <li><strong>Python is Object-Oriented</strong> − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
         <li><strong>Python is a Beginner's Language</strong>− Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h4>Required Resources</h4>
        <p>You will need a a text editor, preferably with syntax highlighting. 
           A few options is Netbeans, Atom, Sublime Text, available on OS X, 
           Windows and Linux. You will need a web browser that includes a 
           debugger such as Chrome or Firefox or Edge. Apple disabled the Safari
           debugger by default, so read instructions to enable it first.</p>

        <h4>Overview</h4> 
        <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
           The latest stable version of Python is v3.8.0 released 14 October 2019. 
           Python is best for :</p>

         <h5>Features</h5>

         <ul>
            <li>Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. 
                                This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
            <li>Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li>
            <li>A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform 
                                           compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
            <li>Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing 
                                   and debugging of snippets of code.</li>
            <li>Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface 
                           on all platforms.</li>
            <li>Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable 
                             programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
            <li>Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li>
            <li>GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system 
                                  calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the 
                                  X Window system of Unix.</li>
            <li>Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below:</p> 

         <ul>
            <li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as 
                well as OOP.</li>
            <li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to 
                byte-code for building large applications.</li>
            <li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports 
                dynamic type checking.</li>
            <li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
            <li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, 
               CORBA, and Java.</li>
         </ul>   

        <h4>Exercise 1: Downloading Python </h4>
        <p>Try running Python interactively from the console built in to your 
            browser.</p>  

        <h5>Instructions</h5>

        <p>Before you start, you will need Python on your computer, but you may 
           not need to download it.</p>

        <p>First of all check that you don't already have Python installed by 
           entering python in a command line window. If you see a response from 
           a Python interpreter it will include a version number in its initial 
           display. Generally any recent version will do, as Python makes every 
           attempt to maintain backwards compatibility - with the exception that 
           Python 2.x and Python 3.x have some intentional differences.</p>

        <p>On Windows, try py first - this is the relatively recent Python Launcher, 
           which has a better chance of avoiding some of the path problems that might 
           occur because on Windows programs don't install into any of the small set 
           of common locations that are searched by default. The Python launcher can 
           also let you select any of the various versions you may have installed 
           from a single command.</p>

        <p>If you need to install Python, you may as well download the most recent 
           stable version. This is the one with the highest number that isn't marked 
           as an alpha or beta release. Please see the Python downloads page for the 
           most up to date versions of Python 2 and Python 3. They are available via 
           the yellow download buttons on that page.</p>

        <p>For advice on choosing between Python 2 and Python 3 see Python 2 or 3.</p>

        <p>If you're running Windows: the most stable Windows downloads are available 
           from the Python for Windows page. On Windows you have a choice between 32-bit 
           (labeled x86) and and 64-bit (labeled x86-64) versions, and several flavors 
           of installer for each. The Python core team thinks there should be a default 
           you don't have to stop and think about, so the yellow download button on the 
           main download page gets you the "x86 executable installer" choice. This is 
           actually a fine choice: you don't need the 64-bit version even if you have 
           64-bit Windows, the 32-bit Python will work just fine.</p>

        <p>If you're running Windows XP: a complete guide to installing ActivePython is 
           at Python on XP: 7 Minutes To "Hello World!". ShowMeDo has two videos for 
           downloading, installing and getting started with Python on a Windows XP 
           machine - this series talks you through the Python, ActivePython and SciPy 
           distributions. Note that the python.org releases only support versions of 
           Windows that are supported by Microsoft (at the time of the release), so no 
           recent release from python.org can be used on WIndows XP.</p>

        <p>If you are using a Mac, see the Python for Mac OS X page. MacOS since 
           10.2 (Jaguar) include a system version of Python, but it is best not to 
           consider this the Python to use for your programming tasks - install a 
           current Python instead. 10.15 (Catalina) is the last MacOS to include a 
           default system Python, as Apple have now deprecated this.</p>

        <p>For Red Hat, CentOS or Fedora, install the python3 and python3-devel 
           packages.</p>

        <p>For Debian or Ubuntu, install the python3.x and python3.x-dev packages.</p>

        <p>For Gentoo, install the '=python-3.x*' ebuild (you may have to unmask it 
           first).</p>

        <p>For other systems, or if you want to install from source, see the general 
           download page.</p>
