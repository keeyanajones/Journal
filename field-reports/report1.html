        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>Always keep the summary short and simple. It is also here 
           that you state the problem concisely, present your findings, 
           and interpret the results briefly. In short, it should be a 
           synopsis of your report. It should contain no figures, but 
           could have a small table.</p>

        <h3>KEY GRAPHS</h3>        
      <p>If it pleases the court, you can present evidence to back up your 
         report. In this case, placing key graphs in your report would help 
         the ones-in-charge or your boss understand the present situation 
         using figures and tables. Even though adding them is important, 
         keep in mind that you cannot add too many tables otherwise, you 
         would risk letting the superiors read absorb too much information 
         that is not really relevant to the problem. In creating tables and 
         figures, it has to be simple enough that even the average person can 
         understand it. It helps to put indicators (legend) to the table and 
         figure to let the higher ups have an idea on what your table is about.</p>

        <h3>BASIC ORGANIZATION</h3>        
      <p>The report should flow nicely from the statement of the problem through 
         design considerations and analysis to results and conclusions. Set up 
         sections with headings which inform the client. The diesel reports had 
         some shortcomings in organization. Learn from those mistakes.</p>
        
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>This is where you begin to state the problem, but with more substantial 
         basis so that they can have a better understanding of what the problem is 
         and where it lies. Indicate on what steps you are undertaking to tackle the 
         problem, and what you plan to share with the client. The introduction should 
         also a phrase about each section of the report briefly.</p>

      <h4>Experimental Design/Materials and Methods</h4>
      <p>Depending on the problem, this may need one or more sections. In this segment,
          you need to identify the aspects of the experiment which are key in order to 
          understand the design. Although some elaboration may be necessary (but
        keep it short) at some point about subtle issues such as subsampling and repeated 
        measures (correlation, etc.).</p>

      <p>It is also this part where questions about the nature of experimental units, 
         blocking, random assignment and the way measurements were taken should be 
         addressed.</p>

         <p>List everything in the report. <br/>

      <h4>Data Exploration/Analysis</h4>        
      <p>This section should clearly speak to the client. Avoid patronizing phrases 
         like ”obviously”, “it is clear that”. But write with enough depth to let the 
         client understand the spirit of what you did, but refer any essential details 
         to an Appendix. Figures (primary) and tables (secondary) should be self contained 
         and tell a major portion of the story, where possible. This section should state 
         what you found and how you found it (sometimes it is useful to do this in two 
         sections). It should be organized to tell the story you uncovered, not the 
         circuitous path you may have taken to get there. Think hard about what should 
         be include and what can be left out. Keep it simple. Ask yourself if you really 
         need an Appendix. Keep it neat; make it self contained. The Appendix, if 
         needed, you can be more technical.</p>

      <h4>Interpretation and Conclusions</h4>
      <p>This section is where you analyze the data you have collated through the data 
         exploration stage. Your report will and should end in the interpretation of data. 
         Aside from data analysis, you should also add conclusions in how the data will affect 
         the topic you have chosen or the respondents of your study (if applicable).</p>

      <h3>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
      <p>After presenting majority of the said report to your higher ups, it is high time that 
         you ask yourself: Now that I know what has been causing the trouble, what can I or my 
         team do to help fix this to avoid this problem to go on any further? This is where you 
         begin to formulate solutions as a countermeasure to solve the present issue at hand. It 
         may take weeks, days or even years, But just remember that all good things take time, no 
         matter how long it eventually takes. In your journey formulating different responsibilities,
          it is a process of trial and error. There can be no assurance whether that short-term 
          or long-term plan would even work without trying. It is expected that there will be some 
          setbacks along the way, which is why it is important to have some backup plan set up so that 
          you can go to it when the initial plan fails.</p>
