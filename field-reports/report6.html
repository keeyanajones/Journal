        <h3>STRATEGY</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>50% of content will drive traffic back to Livestream and Vblog</li>
          <li>25% of content will be curated from other sources</li>
          <li>20% of content will support goals (selling, lead generation, etc.)</li>
          <li>5%  of content will be about gaming, music, and urban culture</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CONTENT</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>promotes business, converts readers, and generates profit</li>
          <li>shares ideas and stories from leaders and like-minded</li>
          <li>involves personal interactions with audience</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>LESSONS LEARNED</h3>
          <p>Facebook and YouTube are both prime places for ads, perhaps due in part to 
            their high-earning user bases</p>
          <p>LinkedIn’s user base is well-educated, making it a hub for in-depth, 
            industry-specific content that might be more complicated than what you see 
            on Facebook or Twitter</p>

        <p>Engagement metrics to keep an eye on in 2020:</p>

        <h6>key performance indicators (KPIs)</h6>

        <small>

          <li>Net followers and subscribers gain or loss</li>          
          <li>Number of likes</li>

      <h3>RESULTS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Reach:</strong> Post reach is the number of unique users who saw your post. How far is your content spreading across social? Is it actually reaching user’s feeds? In the face of ever-changing organic algorithms, tracking reach is arguably more important than ever.</li>
          <li><strong>Clicks:</strong> This is the number of clicks on your content, company name or logo. Link clicks are critical toward understanding how users move through your marketing funnel. Tracking clicks per campaign is essential to understand what drives curiosity or encourages people to buy.</li>
          <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> The total number of social interactions divided by the number of impressions. For engagement, it’s about seeing who interacted and if it was a good ratio out of your total reach. This sheds light on how well your audience perceives you and their willingness to interact.</li>
          <li><strong>Hashtag performance:</strong> What were your most used hashtags on your own side? Which hashtags were most associated with your brand? Or what hashtags created the most engagement?</li>
          <li><strong>Organic and paid likes:</strong> More than just standard Likes, these likes are defined from paid or organic content. For channels like Facebook, organic engagement is much harder to gain traction, which is why many brands turn to Facebook Ads. However, earning organic likes on Instagram isn’t quite as difficult.</li>
          <li><strong>Sentiment:</strong> This is the measurement of how users reacted to your content, brand or hashtag. Did customers find your recent campaign offensive? What type of sentiment are people associating with your campaign hashtag? It’s always better to dig deeper and find what people are saying.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> 

        <p>A good consistent social media strategy will:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>get more traffic</li>
          <li>relationship building</li>
          <li>better customer satisfaction/retention</li>
          <li>better customer service</li>
        </ul>  

        <p>The foundation of the strategy is to understand who your target audience is and 
          why they use social media. These demographics and psychographics refer to 
          statistics that describe a group of people. Not all of these will be relevant 
          to your business. </p>

        <h4>Demographics</h4>
        
        <p>Determining demographics depends on whether or not you already have a 
          site and traffic:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you don't have a site or traffic yet, find a similar site and use 
              it for analysis.</li>
          <li>If you have a site that does have traffic, you have a few options.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>First, you can use typical search engine tools to find your competitors.
          Go to the competitors web sites and use their search features. The more popular 
          the site is, the more accurate the data will be.</p>     
                
        <p>Another option is to use the keyword searches that describes your niche. 
          For example, in my case I would enter “live node.js game development”.  
          Try several keywords to get a good idea of your target market.</p>
          
        <p>A final way to get demographic information is with Analytics tools offered by 
          the platform or any analytic tool of choice.  If you haven’t enabled these before, 
          you might have to do so and wait 24 hours to get data. However, once data is 
          collected, you will see graphs for relevant data that represents your actual 
          audience.</p> 
                    
        <p>In most cases your platform’s analytics is the best source of information, 
          if available. Try to record all this data in a text or spreadsheet files. 
          So far, my demographics for the new site:</p>
          
        <ul>
          <li>Gender: largely males with very few females. 
          <li>Education: relatively educated, but slightly more than Internet average.
          <li>Location: most likely from US, UK, and India.
          <li>Age: average age is about 30. 
          <li>Income: likely medium to medium high income due to relatively career and age.
        </ul>
               
        <p>Notice that some of those parameters are more definite than others. 
          The first time, estimate some demographics. Over time, refine these 
          as more is learned about the actual audience.</p>

        <h4>Psychographics</h4>

        <p>Psychographics tell us the why create content and products that 
          the target audience actually wants, to understand more about the 
          audience’s outlook on topic.  Questions to answer include:</p>
          
        <ul>  
          <li>Why do they want to learn about [the niche]?</li>
          <li>How important is [the niche] to them? (i.e., is it a hobby or
              part of their job?)</li>
          <li>How do they like to learn? (e.g., video, text, audio, etc., 
              and on what type of device)</li>
          <li>What common questions do they have about [the niche]?</li>
          <il>How knowledgeable are they about [the niche]?</il>
        </ul>
              
        <p>This is crucial strategically because there are no tools that give URL 
          or keyword search results with psychographic information. The only way to 
          answer these questions is to observe the target audience.  The idea is 
          to find your exact target audience.</p>

        <p>For example, If you’re targeting those who are interested in javaScript 
          development based on the latest libraries and frameworks, that group of 
          people is going to be different from the group interested in web development
          because of node application development.</p>

        <h4>In my case:</h4>

        <ul>

        <p>1 - The Platforms:<br/> <br/>
          YOUTUBE<br/> 
          TWITCH<br/> 
          MIXER<br/> 
          FACEBOOK<br/>
          TWITTER<br/> 
          GITHUB<br/> 
          DISCORD<br/>
        </p>       
          
        <p>Start by searching the niche on the platform you are using. 
          There’s usually a community for everything and this is always a good 
          place to start.</p>

        <p>For example, I searched for “node.js”. Based on these search results, I 
          would stick with Science &amp; Technology on Twitch. Try to find a 
          relevant community with at least a few thousand followers.  In the case 
          of Youtube subscribers.</p>

        <sup>NOTE: The terms subscriber and follower mean different things on 
                   different platforms. Please check the platforms guide to 
                   understand the difference. </sup>

        <p>Next, simply watch and read the descriptions or introductions. 
          If you’re not familiar with the platform, read the guide for that 
          particular platform to understand what you’re looking at first. 
          You will see alot of the same type of information over and over again.
          The information will tell you what people are interested in 
          learning about, while the most repeated data will help you 
          understand how people like to learn about it.</p>

        <p>Typically, you can filter result based on some criteria; for example, 
          most popular of all time.  Some of these results will be dominated by 
          videos from the same content creator.  In this case, that alone tells 
          how this community likes to consume information.  After looking at the 
          first 100 links or so, you see that this community cares about:</p>

        <ul>  
          <li>rest api </li>
          <li>security </li>
          <li>all in one video</li>
          <li>learning about express, mongodb, and angular </li>
          <li>creating practical clean code with JavaScript</li>
        </ul><br/>

        <p>2 - Forums: <br/> 
          Another place where you can see your target readers interact is 
          in a forum. Just search Google for “[niche] forum,” and you’ll get a list 
          of results.  In some cases, there will be a specific forum for you niche.
          Stack Overflow is one of the most popular forums for technology and has
          the ability to be linked to other </p>

        <p><sub>NOTE: Careful forums that have the readers you are interested in attracting. 
        Otherwise, your results will be inaccurate. There’s a big difference between 
        someone learning about javascript to create a api and someone looking to 
        create a game.</sub></p>
        
        <p>3 - Comments: <br/> 
          If you can find a popular blog and livestream discussions that relates very 
          closely to the niche, this may be an option. For example, the comments on a 
          Youtube channel discussion question.  Read through the comments and record 
          observations about the readers.</p>

        </ul>
