          Quality Factor Classification</h2>                  
     
        <p><sup>Last updated on January 1st, 2019</sup></p>

                  Quality Factor Classification</a></li>
        </ol>        
                                 
      <p>This model classifies all software requirements into 13 software 
         quality factors. The 13 factors are grouped into four product 
         categories – operation, revision, transition, and other factors.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Operation Factors − Correctness, Reliability, Efficiency, Integrity,
            Usability</li>
        <li>Revision Factors − Maintainability, Flexibility, Testability</li>
        <li>Transition Factors − Portability, Reusability, Interoperability</li>
        <li>Other Factors - Understandability, Conciseness and Consistency</li>
      </ul>

      <a name="operation" id="operation"></a>                  
      <h3>Operation Factors</h3>
      <p>The operation factor category includes five quality factors, 
         which deal with the requirements that directly affect the daily 
         operation of the software. They are as follows:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Correctness</li>
        <p>Presence of all constituent parts, with each part fully developed. 
           This means that if the code calls a subroutine from an external 
           library, the software package must provide reference to that library
           and all required parameters must be passed. All required input data 
           must also be available. These requirements deal with the correctness
           of the output of the software system. They include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Output mission</li>
          <li>The required accuracy of output that can be negatively affected 
              by inaccurate data or inaccurate calculations.</li>
          <li>The completeness of the output information, which can be affected 
              by incomplete data.</li>
          <li>The up-to-dateness of the information defined as the time between 
              the event and the response by the software system.</li>
          <li>The availability of the information.</li>
          <li>The standards for coding and documenting the software system.</li>
        </ul>

        <br/>
        
        <li>Reliability</li>
        <p>Ability to be expected to perform its intended functions 
            satisfactorily. This implies a time factor in that a reliable 
            product is expected to perform correctly over a period of time. It 
            also encompasses environmental considerations in that the product 
            is required to perform correctly in whatever conditions it finds 
            itself (sometimes termed robustness).  Reliability requirements 
            deal with service failure. They determine the maximum allowed 
            failure rate of the software system, and can refer to the entire 
            system or to one or more of its separate functions.</p>

        <li>Efficiency</li>
        <p>Fulfillment of purpose without waste of resources, such as memory, 
            space and processor utilization, network bandwidth, time, etc.  It 
            deals with the hardware resources needed to perform the different 
            functions of the software system. It includes processing 
            capabilities (given in MHz), its storage capacity (given in MB or 
            GB) and the data communication capability (given in MBPS or 
            GBPS).</p>

        <p>It also deals with the time between recharging of the system’s 
            portable units, such as, information system units located in 
            portable computers, or meteorological units placed outdoors.</p>

        <li>Integrity</li>
        <p>Ability to protect data against unauthorized access and to withstand 
           malicious or inadvertent interference with its operations. Besides 
           the presence of appropriate security mechanisms such as 
           authentication, access control and encryption, security also implies 
           resilience in the face of malicious, intelligent and adaptive 
           attackers.  This factor deals with the software system security, 
           that is, to prevent access to unauthorized persons, also to 
           distinguish between the group of people to be given read as well as 
           write permit.</p>

        <li>Usability</li>
        <p>Convenience and practicality of use. This is affected by such things 
            as the human-computer interface. The component of the software that 
            has most impact on this is the user interface (UI), which for best 
            usability is usually graphical (i.e. a GUI).  Usability requirements
            deal with the staff resources needed to train a new employee and to 
            operate the software system.</p>
      </ul>

      <a name="revision" id="revision"></a>            
      <h3>Revision Factors</h3>
      <p>Three quality factors are included in the revision category. These 
          factors are as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Maintainability</li>
        <p>Propensity to facilitate updates to satisfy new requirements. Thus 
           the software product that is maintainable should be well-documented, 
           should not be complex, and should have spare capacity for memory, 
           storage and processor utilization and other resources.  This factor 
           considers the efforts that will be needed by users and maintenance 
           personnel to identify the reasons for software failures, to correct 
           the failures, and to verify the success of the corrections.</p>

        <li>Flexibility</li>
        <p>This factor deals with the capabilities and efforts required to 
           support adaptive maintenance activities of the software. These 
           include adapting the current software to additional circumstances 
           and customers without changing the software. This factor’s 
           requirements also support perfecting maintenance activities, such as 
           changes and additions to the software in order to improve its 
           service and to adapt it to changes in the firm’s technical or 
           commercial environment.</p>

        <li>Testability</li>
        <p>Disposition to support acceptance criteria and evaluation of 
           performance. Such a characteristic must be built-in during the 
           design phase if the product is to be easily testable; a complex 
           design leads to poor testability.  Testability requirements deal 
           with the testing of the software system as well as with its 
           operation. It includes predefined intermediate results, log files, 
           and also the automatic diagnostics performed by the software system 
           prior to starting the system, to find out whether all components of 
           the system are in working order and to obtain a report about the 
           detected faults. Another type of these requirements deals with 
           automatic diagnostic checks applied by the maintenance technicians 
           to detect the causes of software failures.</p>
      </ul>

      <a name="transition" id="transition"></a>                  
      <h3>Transition Factors</h3>
      <p>Three quality factors are included in the transition category 
          that deals with the adaptation of software to other environments and 
          its interaction with other software systems. These factors are as 
          follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Portability</li>
        <p>Ability to be run well and easily on multiple computer 
           configurations. Portability can mean both between different 
           hardware; such as running on a PC as well as a smartphone and 
           between different operating systems such as running on both Mac OS 
           X and GNU/Linux. Portability requirements tend to the adaptation of 
           a software system to other environments consisting of different 
           hardware, different operating systems, and so forth. The software 
           should be possible to continue using the same basic software in 
           diverse situations.</p>

        <li>Reusability</li>
        <p>This factor deals with the use of software modules originally 
           designed for one project in a new software project currently being 
           developed. They may also enable future projects to make use of a 
           given module or a group of modules of the currently developed 
           software. The reuse of software is expected to save development 
           resources, shorten the development period, and provide higher 
           quality modules.</p>

        <li>Interoperability</li>
        <p>Interoperability requirements focus on creating interfaces with other
           software systems or with other equipment firmware. For example, the 
           firmware of production machinery and testing equipment interfaces
           with the quality control software.</p>
      </ul>

      <a name="other" id="other"></a>                  
      <h3>Other Quality Factors</h3>
      <p>Two quality factors are included in the other category. These 
         factors are as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Understandability</li>
        <p>Clarity of purpose in the real world. This goes further than just a 
           statement of purpose; all of the design and user documentation must 
           be clearly written so that it is easily understandable. This is 
           obviously subjective in that the user context must be taken into 
           account: for instance, if the software product is to be used by 
           software engineers it is not required to be understandable to the 
           sales staff.</p>

        <p>For example, are variable names descriptive of the physical or 
           functional property represented? Do uniquely recognizable functions 
           contain adequate comments so that their purpose is clear? Are 
           deviations from forward logical flow adequately commented? Are all 
           elements of an array functionally related?</p>

        <li>Conciseness and Consistency</li>
        <p>Minimization of excessive or redundant information or processing. 
           This is important where memory capacity is limited, and it is 
           generally considered good practice to keep lines of code to a 
           minimum. It can be improved by replacing repeated functionality by 
           one subroutine or function which achieves that functionality. It 
           also applies to document uniformity in notation, symbology, 
           appearance, and terminology within itself.</p>

        <p>For example, is all code reachable? Is any code redundant? How many 
           statements within loops could be placed outside the loop, thus 
           reducing computation time? Are branch decisions too complex?  Is one 
           variable name used to represent different logical or physical 
           entities in the program? Does the program contain only one 
           representation for any given physical or mathematical constant? Are 
           functionally similar arithmetic expressions similarly constructed? 
           Is a consistent scheme used for indentation, nomenclature, the color 
           palette, fonts and other visual elements?</p>
      </ul>

        <p>Alright, let's recap what I've just learned:</p>
    
        <ul>
            13 factors grouped into four categories:
            <ol>               
              <li>Operation Factors − Correctness, Reliability, Efficiency, Integrity, Usability</li>
              <li>Revision Factors − Maintainability, Flexibility, Testability</li>
              <li>Transition Factors − Portability, Reusability, Interoperability</li>
              <li>Other Factors - Understandability, Conciseness and Consistency</li>
