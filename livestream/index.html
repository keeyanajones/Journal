        <p>Live streaming is media simultaneously recorded and broadcast in 
           real time or media delivered and played back simultaneously without 
           requiring a completely downloaded file.  Non-live media such as 
           video-on-demand, vlogs, and YouTube videos are technically streamed, 
           but not live streamed.</p>

        <p>User interaction via chat rooms are a major component of live streaming. 
           Platforms often include the ability to talk to the broadcaster or 
           participate in conversations in chat.  In this case chat refers to a 
           communication over the Internet real-time of text messages from sender 
           to receiver.  Primarily any direct text-based or video-based, one-to-any 
           chat, using tools such as instant messengers, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) 
           or any online service with users in a multi-user environment.  </p>

        <span class="fab fa-youtube fa-5x" aria-hidden="true"
              style="float:left; padding: 16px;"><br/></span>

        <p>In the case of Mixer and Twitch, users can send a private chat messager 
           to other users via the whisper feature.  Youtube has no whisper feature 
           but Facebook has its own messenger application.  Chat messages are 
           generally short in order to enable other participants to respond 
           quickly. Another common chat related feature are emotes to express 
           emotion, particularly when you're chatting in a livestream. </p>

        <p>David M. Ewalt referred to Twitch.tv as "the ESPN of video games". The 
           website spawned from and grew to overshadow Justin.tv, and was purchased 
           by Amazon.com at the end of 2014 for $970 million USD. Other video-game 
           oriented streaming websites include Smashcast.tv, which was formed after 
           the merging of Azubu and Hitbox.tv, and the South Korea-based afreecaTV. 
           In 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented sub-site 
           and app that is intended to compete with Twitch.</p>

        <p>An example of a notable live streamed event is Games Done Quick, a charity 
           speedrunning marathon hosted on Twitch. Viewers are encouraged to donate 
           for incentives during the stream such as naming characters in a run, 
           having the runners attempt more difficult challenges, or winning prizes. 
           Over $10 million has been raised across sixteen marathons.</p>

        <span class="fab fa-twitch fa-5x" aria-hidden="true"
              style="float:left; padding: 16px;"><br/></span>

        <p>Professional streamers can generate livable revenue from viewer subscriptions 
           and donations, as well as platform advertisements and sponsorships from eSports 
           organizations, often earning much more from streaming than from tournament 
           winnings. The audiences of professional gaming tournaments are primarily 
           live stream viewers in addition to live audiences inside venues. The 
           International 2017, a Dota 2 tournament with the largest prize pool in eSport 
           history, was primarily streamed through Twitch, having a peak of over five 
           million concurrent viewers.</p>

        <h4>Metrics</h4>

        <p>With live streaming becoming a financially viable market, particularly for 
           esports, streamers and organizations representing them have looked for metrics 
           to quantify the viewership of streams as to be able to determine pricing for 
           advertisers. Metrics like maximum number of concurrent viewers, or number of 
           subscribers do not readily account for how long a viewer may stay to watch a 
           stream.The most common metric is the "Average Minute Audience" (AMA), which is 
           obtained by taking the total minutes watched by all viewers on the stream 
           during the streamed event and for 24 hours afterwards, divided by the number 
           of minutes that were broadcast.</p>

        <p>The AMA is comparable to the same metric that the Nielsen ratings for tracking 
           viewership. This also makes it possible to combine standard broadcast and 
           streaming routes for events that are simulcasted on both forms of delivery 
           to estimate total audience size Major events with reported AMA include 
           streamed National Football League games; for example, the average AMA for NFL 
           games in 2018 ranged from 240,000 to 500,000 across streaming services, with 
           the following Super Bowl LIV having an AMA of 2.6 million. In comparison, the 
           esports Overwatch League had an average of 313,000 average minute audience during 
           regular season games in its 2019 season.</p>

        <h4>Social Media</h4>

        <p>User interaction via chat rooms forms a major component of live streaming. 
           Platforms often include the ability to talk to the broadcaster or participate 
           in conversations in chat. The idea is to use social media to gain website 
           traffic or attention through sites creating content that you have tailored 
           to the context of each individual platform in order to drive user engagement 
           and sharing.</p>

        <p>Live stream services encompass a wide variety of topics, from social media to 
           video games to professional sports. Platforms such as Facebook Live, Periscope, 
           Kuaishou, and 17 include the streaming of scheduled promotions and celebrity 
           events as well as streaming between users, as in videotelephony. Sites such as 
           Twitch.tv have become popular outlets for watching people play video games, 
           such as in eSports, Let's Play-style gaming, or speedrunning. Live coverage of 
           sporting events is a common application.</p>

        <h4>Events</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Celebrity Promotion</li>
            <li>Speed Runs</li>
            <li>Esports</li>
            <li>Challenges</li>
            <li>Leaderboards</li>
            <li>Let's Play</li>
            <li>Watch Me</li>
            <li>Just Chatting</li>
            <li>Charity</li>
            <li>News</li>
            <li>Sports</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Applications</h4>

        <p>To publish and record live streams at the same time include MotionCaster, 
           Open Broadcaster Software, Wirecast, and XSplit Broadcaster. They are used 
           to publish streams to Youtube, Facebook, Periscope and Twitch.tv, among 
           others.</p>

        <h4>What I watch</h4>

        <p>I don't like to participate in channels that have large communities.  The chat is 
           usually to fast and in slow mode so the communication in the community chat during 
           the stream is confusing.  I love the ability to show dedication to a channel thanks 
           to stuff like channel progression and badges.  I typically watch every streaming 
           platform!  Youtube, Twitch, Mixer, Facebook, and others depending on what I am 
           looking for.  I often find my self looking for strategy's to beat something in a 
           game, no commentary walkthrough's and game movies, original sound tracks, cheat 
           codes for retro games, art work, leaderboards, and locations.  </p>

        <h4>What I stream</h4>

        <p>I have never wanted to stream.  I like to watch them but I never wanted to do it 
           because I don't think I would be very interesting.  Programming on a Live Stream
           and getting worked up to role play when I play a game would just make no sense to 
           anyone but me.  I have worked behind the scenes on some streams but no I don't 
           think its for me.  I do make technology specifically for streaming so I will 
           have to live stream.</p>

        <h4>Mixer</h4>

        <p>When MixPlay is enabled, anything can happen. On Mixer, streamers and 
        viewers are more connected than ever before. Tune in to vote on dialogue 
        and decisions, help or challenge streamers in their games, and even 
        summon mobs in Minecraft. Or use MixPlay to enhance streams with overlays, 
        stats, and other useful information.</p>

        <p>In the case of  Mixer, users can also use 'sparks' one of two on site 
        currencies (embers is the other) to purchase 'skills'.  Skills are 
        large and animated emotes to post in the channels chat. You can also 
        use commands in the chat like '/mute @username' in the chat to mute 
        other users.</p>  

        <h4>Channel Progression</h4>

        <p>You rank up by participating in that channel. To find out how you can 
        gain more hearts, click the icon to the left of the chat input box. 
        Hearts are experience points for the channel. The more you get, the more 
        you'll rank up!  Currently the channel owner can set the max rank but 
        the default is 99.</p>

        <p>Channel Progression is a per channel ranking system that allows you to 
        show your dedication to that channel! You can rank up by interacting in 
        a channel and get a fancy badge next to your name as you progress. </p>
        
        <p>There is currently no way to turn off Channel Progression from 
        the channel side or user's end.  All channels on Mixer have Channel 
        Progression enabled and rank is earned hearts while using Mixer on 
        any platform. The owners can manually grant hearts to and remove 
        hearts from my viewers.</p>

        <p>Channel progression lets you rank up in a 
        stream by “watching”, “chatting”, “following”, “subscribing” and more. 
        The typical progression:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Watch - Earn Hearts for every five minutes you watch  - 100 hearts</li>
            <li>Chat - Earn Hearts when you chat in channel – 5 hearts</li>
            <li>Follow - Earn Hearts when you follow – 500 hearts</li>
            <li>Subscribe - Earn Hearts when you subscribe  - 12,000 hearts</li>
            <li>Gift Subscription -  Earn Hearts when you gift subscriptions to other viewers – 12,000 hearts</li>
            <li>Sparks - Support broadcasters and earn 10 Hearts for every 83 Sparks spent – 10 hearts</li>
            <li>Embers - Support broadcasters and earn Hearts for every Ember spent </li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can also see your rank by clicking the “Your Rank” button at the 
           bottom left hand corner of the chat box.  Mixer Partners are able to 
           reward additional monetization actions like “subscribing”, gift 
           subscriptions and Embers spend. Since this is an early version of the 
           experience, they want to hear feedback and ideas. Finally, channel 
           viewers and the public can read the channels chat when the live 
           stream is off line. </p>

          <p>Twitch is a global community of millions who come together each day 
             to create their own entertainment: unique, live, unpredictable, 
             never-to-be repeated experiences created by the magical interactions
             of the many. With chat built into every stream, you don’t just 
             watch on Twitch, you’re a part of the show.</p>

          <p>See <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>
          <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">
              https://www.twitch.tv</a></p>

        <h4>Twitch</h4>

        <p>Twitch Extensions enable you to create live apps that interact with the 
           stream, as a panel on a channel, or with chat. Create interactive experiences 
           such as mini-games, leaderboards, live gear information and more.</p>

        <ul>   
            <li>A panel extension appears in the panel area below the video player. Panel 
                Extensions stay active even when the channel is not live.</li>
            <li>A video-overlay extension renders on top of the video player as a transparent 
                overlay. Viewable only when the channel is live.</li>
            <li>A video-component extension renders on top of both the video player and any 
                video-overlay extensions. Component Extensions take up only part of the screen 
                and can be hidden by viewers. Component Extensions are viewable only when the 
                channel is live.</li> 
        </ul>

        <p>NOTE: Broadcasters can activate up to 6 extensions at a time 3 panel, 1 video 
                 overlay (full screen), and 2 video component (smaller).</p>

        
        <p>Twitch offers an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) interface for chat functionality. 
           Chatbots allow you to programmatically interact with a Twitch chat feed using 
           IRC standards; the bot connects to the Twitch IRC network as a client to 
           perform these actions.</p>

        <p>In the case of  Twitch, users can view and create clips, use 'bits' its on site
           currency to 'cheer'.  You can buy bits on Twitch that show support for streamers, 
           get attention in chat through animated emoticons, get recognition through badges, 
           leaderboards, and acknowledgement from the streamer, and even unlock loot during 
           special esports events like Overwatch League Cheering. Bits also allow you to chat 
           in Sub Only chat rooms. Cheering with Bits celebrates the moments you love with the 
           community, all right in chat. A Cheer is a chat message that uses Bits. </p>

             width="50%" height="50%" style="float:right; padding: 16px;" alt="progression"/><br/>        


        <p>Bits emotes can be used one by one, all at once, or anywhere in between. Using 
           many at once shows more support and creates cooler animated emotes.  Cheering 
           shows your support for the Partner or Affiliate just like subscriptions do, and 
           as you Cheer in a channel, you earn Cheer Chat Badges for that channel so that 
           your support is recognized. Your Cheer Chat Badge lasts indefinitely but will 
           only appear in the channel where you earned it.</p>

        <p>Cheering is now available to Twitch channels worldwide, so all Twitch Partners 
           and Affiliates regardless of where they live can enable Cheering on their 
           channels. Cheer settings are located in the Dashboard -> Affiliate / Partner 
           Settings -> Bits &amp; Cheering.  We are actively working on local payment methods 
           and currencies to support global audiences, but currently Bits may be purchased 
           via Amazon and PayPal payments. It should be noted that international transaction 
           fees may apply in addition to the price of Bits.  Finally, channel viewers and 
           the public can read the channels chat when the live stream is off line in the 
           chat replay. </p>

           wow, sad, and angry are selected by the viewer and displayed on the stream 
           as an animation.  In addition, the viewers get distinctive badges for 
           supporting the channel, being a top contributor, watching often, or becoming 
           a follower.  </p>
